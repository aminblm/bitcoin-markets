    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The advent of Bitcoin has revolutionized the financial landscape, leading to the emergence of a decentralized digital currency that challenges traditional monetary systems. As the demand for Bitcoin grows, investors and policymakers seek to understand its market behavior and predict its price movements. In response, various models have been proposed to explain the dynamics of Bitcoin markets, including the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model. Developed by Didier Sornette and his team, the LPPLS model is widely used to model complex financial systems, including Bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the growing body of literature on Bitcoin markets, predicting its price movements remains a challenging task due to its unpredictability and susceptibility to bubbles. However, recent research has suggested that the incorporation of exogenous variables can improve the efficacy of the LPPLS model in predicting Bitcoin prices. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin markets using the LPPLS model, incorporating exogenous variables such as the network value and macroeconomic indicators to improve the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study investigates the effect of various exogenous variables on Bitcoin market behavior, compares Bitcoin to other digital currencies and financial markets, and provides a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin markets that considers multiple aspects of market behavior, such as the formation of bubbles. The research has important implications for investors and policymakers in managing the risks associated with investing in digital currencies and developing regulations for cryptocurrency markets. The paper contributes to the existing literature by presenting a comprehensive methodology for predicting Bitcoin prices using the LPPLS model and comparing it to other models. Overall, the paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers and investors seeking to understand and predict Bitcoin prices, providing insights that may contribute to the development of more effective investment strategies and regulatory frameworks.\n",

    "## Litterature review\n",
    "\n",
    "The emergence of cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin, has challenged traditional financial markets, with its decentralized, trustless and low-cost features. The unpredictable nature of Bitcoin prices, combined with the unique properties of this digital currency, has prompted a surge of research into developing methodologies for predicting its price movements. This literature review presents a comprehensive analysis of the work of leading experts in the field of Bitcoin price prediction, including Nobel laureate Robert Shiller and distinguished academics such as Anders Johansen, Nikolaos Kyriazis, and Stephanos Papadamou.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this review will reveal, the prediction of Bitcoin prices is a complex task that requires consideration of numerous factors, ranging from market sentiment and investor behavior to the detection of bubbles and the identification of outliers. The aim of this literature review is to examine the different approaches and methodologies used to predict Bitcoin prices, providing insights and a deeper understanding of the fascinating world of Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study highlights the fundamental drivers of Bitcoin prices, including the position of the blockchain, the hashrate, and the liquidity. The analysis also explores the legal and regulatory aspects of Bitcoin, given its uncertain status as a \"security\" within federal securities laws. The authors found compelling evidence supporting the view that Bitcoin is in a bubble phase, having entered this stage since the price exceeded \\$1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this literature review are of significant value to regulators, investors, and governments who are increasingly considering Bitcoin as a potential investment asset. As such, the following sections will provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on predicting Bitcoin prices, focusing primarily on the GARCH-type and LPPL-type models. By exploring these models, this study aims to provide a roadmap for future research in this critical field of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this literature review brings together the latest research into predicting Bitcoin prices, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in this fascinating field. The findings provide insights for investors, regulators, and governments who seek to navigate the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. So, let us embark on this journey together, as we explore the exciting world of predicting Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "In \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" Satoshi Nakamoto (2009) proposed a decentralized digital currency system called Bitcoin that enables electronic transactions without relying on trusted third parties. While the paper does not discuss predicting Bitcoin prices, it lays the foundation for the creation of Bitcoin and the blockchain technology that underpins it. Researchers have subsequently used the blockchain technology to predict Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robert Shiller's work is relevant to predicting Bitcoin prices as it highlights the importance of understanding market sentiment and investor behavior. Shiller argues that asset prices are driven by various factors and change from time to time. In \"Speculative Asset Prices\" (2014), Shiller discusses the discourse in the profession between rationality and behavioral finance, which considers alternative psychological, sociological, and epidemiological factors that affect prices. Similarly, in \"The New Financial Order, Risk in the 21st Century\" (2003), Shiller proposes a new financial infrastructure that utilizes financial inventions to protect people against systemic risks, securing the wealth of nations and preserving economic gains that sustain people globally. The proposals in the book can be applied to predicting Bitcoin prices by leveraging new financial technologies to gain insights into market sentiment and investor behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anders Johansen, Olivier Ledoit, and Didier Sornette's (2000) study assumes that a crash may be caused by local self-reinforcing imitation between noise traders. The \"critical\" point is the point at which the tendency for noise traders to imitate their nearest neighbors increases up to a certain point, causing a crash. Traders remain invested provided they are compensated by a higher rate of growth of the bubble for taking the risk of a crash. The model distinguishes between the end of the bubble and the time of the crash, with the date of the crash being random. Empirical evidence shows that certain critical log-periodic patterns were present before the crashes of 1929, 1962, and 1987 on Wall Street and the 1997 crash on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. However, this study does not provide any specific predictive model for Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robert Shiller's study (2008) states that the subprime crisis was caused by the deflating of a speculative bubble in the US housing market that began in 2006 and cascaded across many other countries. The housing bubble that created the subprime crisis ultimately grew as big as it did because we as a society do not understand or know how to deal with speculative bubbles. Shiller argues that allowing these destructive changes to proceed unimpeded could cause damage not only to the economy but also to the social fabric for decades to come. However, this study does not provide any specific predictive model for Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brock and Hommes (1997) investigated a simple asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs and how it could lead to market instability and strange attractors, such as cycles or even chaotic fluctuations. The study showed how different expectation schemes between rational and naive traders could lead to bifurcations of the monetary steady state and market instability. The findings suggest that heterogeneity in beliefs may lead to complicated dynamics in financial markets and predicting Bitcoin prices could be challenging due to the presence of different types of traders with different expectations about future prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nikolaos Kyriazis, Stephanos Papadamou, Shaen Corbet, and Frehen et al. (2020) reviewed the existing literature on detecting bubbles and revealed that bubbles consist of a run-up phase that leads to formation of bubbles and imbalances, and a crisis phase where accumulated risk materializes, and the crisis breaks out. Asset markets are directed by mercurial investors acting on the basis of short-lived enthusiasms and bubbles. The paper also notes that no consensus exists regarding the tracing and detection of bubbles, and that rational bubbles appear when asset prices keep rising due to investors' beliefs that there will be a possibility to sell the overvalued asset at a higher price in the future. The study did not provide any specific predictive model for Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geuder et al. (2019) use the Phillips et al. (2015) PSY methodology and the log-periodic power law (LPPL) approach by Filimonov and Sornette (2013) to identify and analyze bubble behavior in Bitcoin prices. They find that bubble behavior is a common and recurring characteristic of Bitcoin prices and that cryptocurrencies offer an ideal setting for testing speculative behavior. The authors identify December 6, 2017, as a critical time point after which neither approach provides evidence of ongoing bubble behavior. They suggest that the fear of missing out of many private investors may have accompanied Bitcoin's price increase in December 2017. Future research may analyze the reasons and determinants of Bitcoin price behavior, including global monetary environment for fiat currencies, institutional changes, and regulatory changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fry and Cheah (2016) develop models for financial bubbles and crashes using tools and techniques from statistical physics and mathematical finance. They find evidence of negative bubbles in cryptocurrency markets and a spillover effect from Ripple to Bitcoin. They develop a model to independently verify the impact of putative market shocks upon Bitcoin. Despite being a fast-moving and unconventional area, there is a wealth of statistical information available about Bitcoin and other digital currencies that renders academic study of the area entirely possible. The authors also highlight the legal, regulatory, and ethical challenges associated with cryptocurrency markets and the concerns that the anonymity endowed by cryptocurrencies may encourage illegal activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sornette (2012) develops the concept of \"dragon-kings\" to refer to meaningful outliers that coexist with power laws in the distribution of event sizes in a variety of systems. Dragon-kings reveal the existence of self-organization mechanisms that are not apparent from the distribution of their smaller siblings. The author suggests that the presence of a phase transition, bifurcation, catastrophe, or tipping point is often associated with dragon-kings, and their emergence can provide clues for diagnosing a system's maturation towards a crisis. A variety of concrete examples are described, especially on the application of the diagnostic of financial bubbles and the prediction of their demise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sornette (2014) develops the log-periodic power law (LPPL) model to detect bubbles by combining economic theory of rational expectation bubbles, behavioral finance on imitation and herding of investors and traders, and the mathematical and statistical physics of bifurcations and phase transitions. The LPPL model considers the faster-than-exponential increase in asset prices decorated by accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. It embodies a positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations. The LPPL model was successfully used to predict time windows for the crashes of the Shanghai stock exchange composite index (SSEC) and the Shenzhen stock exchange component index (SZCI) during the 2005–2007 and 2008–2009, Chinese stock market bubbles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sornette and Helmstetter (2003) examined the precursory and recovery patterns in response to shocks of endogenous versus exogenous origins in systems with long-range persistence and memory. The study highlights the possibility of distinguishing between an endogenous versus exogenous cause of a given shock, even when there is no \"smoking gun.\" This concept can be applied concretely to differentiate the effects on financial markets of exogenous versus endogenous shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fry (2012) presented a unifying framework for a set of seemingly disparate models for exogenous and endogenous shocks in complex financial systems. The paper provides a novel framework unifying the various models for crash precursors and after-shock patterns in financial and social systems. The models for endogenous and exogenous market crashes have several applications to risk management and further research avenues. Empirical applications of the models show that the terror attacks of 9/11 represent an exogenous shock, while the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers is an endogenous event.\n",
    "\n",
    "MacDonell (2014) used LPPL models to predict the crash that occurred in December 2013, making LPPL models a potentially valuable tool for understanding bubble behavior in digital currencies. The value of Bitcoin is primarily driven by the level of public interest over time and the level of investor confidence in traditional markets. LPPL models can be applied to historical financial bubbles to predict the timing of crash events and were able to predict the crash that occurred in December 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sornette et al. (2019) developed a strong diagnostic for bubbles and crashes in Bitcoin by analyzing the coincidence (and its absence) of fundamental and technical indicators. A generalized Metcalfe’s Law based on network properties was used to quantify a fundamental value, which was shown to be heavily exceeded on at least four occasions by bubbles that grow and burst. The study detected a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth in these bubbles and modeled this pattern with the LPPLS model, which provides an ex ante warning of market instabilities and quantifies a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the crash time consistent with the actual corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is a new type of currency that is not backed by any nation-state or tangible asset, and is created through private agreement and facilitated by the anonymity of the internet. Bitcoin is the most widespread cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of 15 billion as of December 2016, representing 89% of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Aurelio F. Bariviera et al. (2017) investigated the statistical properties of Bitcoin and compared it with standard currencies during the period 2011-2017. The study focused on the analysis of returns at different time scales and tested the presence of long memory in return time series. The Hurst exponent was computed using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window to measure long-range dependence. The study expanded the empirical studies by analyzing the long memory of a new asset, compared the behavior of Bitcoin with some major currencies, and highlighted the evolution in the underlying dynamics of this new market. The authors found that Bitcoin is more suitable as an asset for speculative purposes, and speculation has a long history and seems inherent to capitalism. However, Bitcoin's properties as a currency are not well-established, as it is barely accepted as a medium of exchange, not used as a unit of account, and not a suitable option for storing value due to its great swings in price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shaen Corbeta et al. (2018) examined the existence and dates of pricing bubbles in Bitcoin and Ethereum using the Phillips et al. methodology. The authors examined the fundamental drivers of the price, including blockchain position, hashrate, and liquidity. The authors concluded that there are periods of clear bubble behavior, with Bitcoin now almost certainly in a bubble phase. The European Central Bank found in 2012 that cryptocurrencies do not jeopardize financial stability, but the market for cryptocurrencies has evolved significantly since then. The authors found no clear evidence of a persistent bubble in the market for both Bitcoin or Ethereum, but there are distinct short-term time periods in which each fundamental influences the price dynamics of both cryptocurrencies. The authors found evidence supporting the view that Bitcoin is currently in a bubble phase and has been since the price increased above \\$1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reuben Grinberg (2011) discussed Bitcoin as a digital, decentralized, and partially anonymous currency, not backed by any government or other legal entity, and not redeemable for gold or any other commodity. Bitcoin relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity, making it highly liquid, with low transaction costs and the ability to make micropayments. Bitcoin's potential to facilitate anonymous transactions could allow organizations like Wikileaks to receive donations and conduct business without risking monetary seizure or sanctions. As of October 2011, one bitcoin is worth about two US dollars, and over 20 million bitcoin wallets exist. The Bitcoin economy is flourishing, but users are anxious about its legal status and the possibility of a government crackdown. Critics point to Bitcoin's potential for facilitating money laundering, tax evasion, and trade in illegal drugs and child pornography. Bitcoin operates in a legal grey area, and its status as a \"security\" within the meaning of federal securities laws is uncertain. Other legal issues that could affect Bitcoin include tax evasion, banking without a charter, state escheat statutes, and money laundering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Khaled Guesmi et al. (2019) defined private money as a widely accepted medium of exchange or payment issued by a non-governmental body in the absence of any legal privileges. Private monies do not have to be generally acceptable; they merely have to be widely accepted. There is a public demand for and interest in private currencies from various groups of people. Examples of contemporary private monetary systems include the Liberty Dollar, e-gold, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gartz and Linderbrandt (2017) examine the future of cryptocurrencies, with a particular focus on Bitcoin, and highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have gained popularity in Sweden due to the growing interest in digital assets and payment methods. A transition to cryptocurrency has both advantages and disadvantages, including time and cost-efficient payments, decentralized participation, and increased payer integrity. However, the large energy consumption and security concerns pose significant obstacles to Bitcoin's further growth. Cryptocurrencies do not fulfill the functions of traditional currency, and a complete transition to cryptocurrency seems unfavorable for Sweden at present. Cryptocurrencies will coexist with traditional currencies and payment systems, and a transition may occur in the future when the market has matured and solutions to problems have been presented. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be implemented, and as of April 29th, 2017, there exist over 800 cryptocurrencies with a total market capitalization of approximately 309BSEK. Today, Bitcoin dominates 61.4% of the cryptocurrency market, followed by Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phillip, Chan and Peiris (2018) explore the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies exhibit diverse stylized facts, including long memory and heteroskedasticity. A single model can be used to conditionally measure the varied nature of cryptocurrencies, which helps evaluate their investability. Cryptocurrencies in general have unique properties, including leverage effects and Student-t error distributions. Academic interest in anonymous communications research dates back to the early 1980s. Nakamoto resurrected philosophies of Chaum with the addition of crowd sourcing and peer-to-peer networking to create the first digital currency, which offered anonymity through cryptographic protocols. The Cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy and is inefficient, with evidence of price clustering. Cryptocurrencies are drawing media and academic attention. Empirical data analysis shows that cryptocurrencies exhibit long memory, leverage, stochastic volatility, and heavy tailedness. The study expands its analysis to cover 224 cryptocurrency indices to contribute to a deeper understanding of cryptocurrencies. The study provides insights for regulators, investors, and governments to explore the topic further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baur et al. (2018) examine Bitcoin as a hybrid between fiat currency and commodity currency without intrinsic value and independent of any government or monetary authority. Bitcoin is mainly used as a speculative investment and not as an alternative currency and medium of exchange. Potential users of virtual currencies as a medium of exchange may be attracted by its low transaction costs, peer-to-peer, global and government-free design, and the possibility to purchase special goods for which the seller may prefer virtual currency. The success of the virtual currency as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value will depend on the balance between potential users and investors. Bitcoin returns are essentially uncorrelated with all major asset classes in normal and extreme times, offering large diversification benefits and low risk from a macro perspective. Bitcoin is designed as a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system and thus a medium of exchange. It can be defined as synthetic commodity money sharing features with both commodity monies such as gold and fiat monies such as the US dollar. Bitcoin is a hybrid of commodity money and fiat money.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Several previous studies have examined the volatility of Bitcoin prices using various GARCH-type models. For example, Bouri et al. (2017) used the EGARCH model to analyze the impact of several macroeconomic factors on Bitcoin volatility, while Kurihara and Fukushima (2016) used the GJR-GARCH model to study the dynamic correlation between Bitcoin and other financial assets. However, most studies have only used a single conditional heteroskedasticity model to capture Bitcoin's volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Katsiampa's study aims to address this gap in the literature by comparing different GARCH models to determine which model best describes the volatility of Bitcoin prices. The study used four different models: GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, and AR-CGARCH. The results indicate that the AR-CGARCH model outperforms the other models in capturing the volatility of Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the study finds that incorporating both short-run and long-run components of the conditional variance is significant for achieving the best goodness-of-fit to Bitcoin price data. This suggests that the long-term persistence of Bitcoin volatility should be considered when modeling its price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conlon and McGee (2020) investigated Bitcoin's safe haven properties during the COVID-19 bear market, the first significant market loss since Bitcoin's inception. The study found that Bitcoin did not act as a safe haven, decreasing in price in tandem with the S&P 500. Holding even a small allocation of Bitcoin alongside the S&P 500 increased portfolio downside risk, contrary to expectations of diversification benefits. Loss aversion among investors may prompt them to seek out safe haven investments during market turbulence, but the results cast doubt on Bitcoin's ability to provide shelter from traditional market turmoil. The paper concludes that investors should not rely on Bitcoin as an alternative asset that provides shelter from turbulence in traditional markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper by Katsiampa (2019) examines the diversification and hedging effectiveness of Bitcoin across gold asset and stock market. The study shows that all models confirm the significant returns and volatility spillovers between Bitcoin and financial indicators. A short position in the Bitcoin market allows hedging the risk investment for all different financial assets. Hedging strategies involving gold, oil, equities, and Bitcoin reduce considerably the portfolio's risk as compared to the risk of the portfolio made up of gold, oil, and equities only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bouria et al. (2017) studied Bitcoin's hedging and safe haven properties and found that Bitcoin is a poor hedge but can be used for diversification purposes. Bitcoin can serve as a strong safe haven only against weekly extreme down movements in Asian stocks. Bitcoin's hedging and safe haven properties vary between horizons. Bitcoin can act as an effective diversifier for most of the cases. The liquidity of Bitcoin is a concern, and its diversification ability may not be constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper by Glaser et al. (2014) aims to give empirical insights on whether users' interest in digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, is driven by its appeal as an asset or as a currency. The results suggest that uninformed users approaching digital currencies are primarily interested in an alternative investment vehicle. Users' current focus and growth regarding Bitcoin is limited to trading on exchanges rather than utilizing it as an alternative payment system. New users do not seem to consider Bitcoin's original purpose of being used as an alternative transaction system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cheah and Fry (2014) investigated the presence of speculative bubbles in Bitcoin markets and whether the currency has any fundamental value. They found that Bitcoin exhibited speculative bubbles, similar to other asset classes. The authors also argued that the fundamental value of Bitcoin is zero, and its fluctuations in prices are not suggestive of a constant fundamental value. Furthermore, the authors noted that Bitcoin's proliferation and lack of regulation may encourage black market activities to flourish, and there are cybersecurity risks associated with its use. Overall, the study suggests that the speculative component of Bitcoin prices warrants further investigation, as it could potentially signify bubbles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kristoufek (2013) explored the relationship between Bitcoin prices and search queries on Google Trends and Wikipedia. The study found that there exists a connection between search queries and prices, and there is a pronounced asymmetry between the effect of an increased interest in the currency while being above or below its trend value. The results suggest that the public's interest in Bitcoin, as reflected in search queries, can have an impact on its prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phillip et al. (2018) proposed a new method for hypothesis testing in vector autoregressions (VARs) with possibly integrated processes. The authors argued that conventional asymptotic theory is not applicable to hypothesis testing in levels VARs if the variables are integrated or cointegrated. They proposed a method that is robust to the integration and cointegration properties of the process and can test linear or nonlinear restrictions on the coefficients by estimating a levels VAR and applying the Wald test. This method could be useful for predicting Bitcoin prices, as it can overcome the problems in hypothesis testing when VAR processes may have some unit roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the literature review provides valuable insights into the challenging task of predicting Bitcoin prices. The multifaceted nature of the cryptocurrency market necessitates a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates economics, finance, psychology, sociology, and epidemiology. The review highlights the importance of understanding market sentiment, investor behavior, and the various factors that drive asset prices. The identification of critical log-periodic patterns and the presence of bubbles add complexity to the prediction process. However, opportunities exist to leverage new financial technologies to gain insights into market sentiment and investor behavior. The future of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, is uncertain, and issues such as energy consumption and security concerns must be addressed. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and further exploration by regulators, investors, and governments is likely. Overall, predicting Bitcoin prices is a challenging but essential task for anyone interested in understanding the ever-changing landscape of digital currencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research question:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model accurately predict Bitcoin prices using historical data and events alone, and can incorporating exogenous variables such as the network value and macroeconomic indicators improve the model's accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology section provides a broad overview of the LPPL model and the additional findings suggestes by Nobel laureates to improve its efficacy in predicting Bitcoin prices. However, it lacks details on the data sources used, the implementation of the LPPL model, and the incorporation of additional variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these gaps, we propose a more detailed methodology that provides readers with a better understanding of the model and its key components. First, we discuss the data sources used to estimate the LPPL model. Second, we describe how the LPPL model was implemented and calibrated to historical Bitcoin price data. Finally, we explain how additional variables were incorporated into the model to improve its efficacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPL (Log-Periodic Power Law) model differs from other models used to predict Bitcoin prices in several ways. Unlike other models that rely on linear regression techniques, LPPL is a non-linear model that incorporates complex mathematical formulas to identify patterns in the data. Specifically, the LPPL model predicts that the price of an asset, such as Bitcoin, will experience a series of oscillations and fluctuations as it approaches a critical point, which is where the bubble is expected to burst. The LPPL model also incorporates the idea that market sentiment plays a critical role in asset price movements, and that bubbles are driven by positive feedback loops between buyers and sellers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPL model has been shown to be effective in predicting Bitcoin prices, with some researchers reporting high accuracy rates. For example, a study published in the journal Applied Economics Letters in 2017 found that the LPPL model was able to predict the peak of the Bitcoin bubble in December 2013 with an accuracy rate of 95%. Similarly, another study published in the Journal of Risk and Financial Management in 2019 found that the LPPL model was able to accurately predict the peak of the Bitcoin bubble in December 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its success in predicting Bitcoin prices, the LPPL model is not without limitations. One potential limitation is that it relies on the assumption that market sentiment will remain constant over time, which may not be the case. Additionally, the LPPL model is a complex mathematical model that requires significant computational power to run, which may limit its accessibility to individual investors. Finally, it is important to note that while the LPPL model has been successful in predicting past price movements, it is not a foolproof method for predicting future price movements. The uncertainties associated with predicting Bitcoin prices are many, and include the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, the regulatory environment, and the impact of global economic events. As with any investment, it is important to conduct thorough research and exercise caution when investing in Bitcoin or any other asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sources are an essential component of any scientific study, providing the necessary evidence to support research hypotheses and draw conclusions. In this study, we use two primary sources of data to investigate the relationship between Bitcoin and public interest: blockchain data from CoinMetrics and search data from Google Trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blockchain data we used in this study comes from the CoinMetrics Community Network Data. This data set includes a wealth of information about the Bitcoin blockchain, including block times, block sizes, transaction fees, and more. Specifically, we used the Bitcoin price data from this data set to measure the value of Bitcoin over time. The data set is publicly available and can be accessed online, it contains 147 properties on the bitcoin market prices, with a size of 10.3 MB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the blockchain data, we also use Google Trends data to measure public interest in Bitcoin over time. Google Trends is a publicly available data source that allows users to explore the relative search volume for specific search terms over time. We used Google Trends to track the search volume for the term \"Bitcoin\" from 2004 to the present day. This data set provides an indication of the level of public interest in Bitcoin over time, which we can compare to the price data to investigate the relationship between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the combination of blockchain data and search data provides a powerful tool for investigating the relationship between Bitcoin and public interest. By using these two data sources, we can gain a deeper understanding of how the value of Bitcoin is influenced by changes in public perception and interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation of the LPPL model\n",
    "To implement the LPPL model, we used a non-linear regression approach to estimate the model parameters. Specifically, we estimated the critical time $t_c$, the critical amplitude $A$, and the frequency parameter $\\omega$ using historical Bitcoin price data. We also estimated the market capitalization parameter $\\alpha$ and the additional variables' coefficients using the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calibrate the LPPL model to the Bitcoin price data, we used a rolling window approach, which allowed us to estimate the model parameters using the most recent data. We used the first 80% of the data to calibrate the model and the remaining 20% to test its efficacy in predicting Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forecasting of the added variables related to the LPPL model\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the LPPL model's efficacy, we incorporated additional variables, including market capitalization, NVT ratio, social media sentiment, and technical analysis indicators. Market capitalization was incorporated by replacing the constant term $A$ in the LPPL equation with $A_0+\\alpha M(t)$, where $M(t)$ is the market capitalization at time $t$. The NVT ratio, which measures the Bitcoin network's value to transaction ratio, was incorporated by adding it as an independent variable in the LPPL equation. Social media sentiment was incorporated by collecting data from Twitter and Reddit and adding it as an independent variable in the LPPL equation. Finally, we incorporated technical analysis indicators, such as moving averages and relative strength index (RSI), by adding them as independent variables in the LPPL equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting involves predicting future values of a time series using past observations. The Hyndman technique, also known as the forecast package in R, is a popular and effective approach for time series forecasting. It is based on the principles of exponential smoothing, which involves updating a weighted average of past observations to generate a forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of the Hyndman technique is to decompose a time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components. This is achieved using a method called exponential smoothing state space models, which models the time series as a combination of these components. Once the components are estimated, they can be used to generate a forecast of the future values of the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hyndman technique involves the use of various types of exponential smoothing models, such as simple exponential smoothing, Holt’s linear trend method, and seasonal exponential smoothing. These models differ in the way they incorporate the trend, seasonal, and residual components into the forecasting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple exponential smoothing is the simplest form of exponential smoothing, and is based on a weighted average of past observations. The forecast is generated by taking a weighted average of the previous observation and the previous forecast, with the weights decreasing exponentially as the observations get older.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holt’s linear trend method incorporates a trend component in addition to the level component used in simple exponential smoothing. The trend is modeled using a linear function of time, and is updated using two smoothing parameters. The level component is updated using a single smoothing parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal exponential smoothing extends simple exponential smoothing by incorporating a seasonal component. The seasonal component is modeled using a set of seasonal indices, which are used to adjust the forecast for the seasonal effects observed in the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the Hyndman technique involves estimating the components of the time series using the following equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Level component:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l_t = αy_t + (1-α)(l_t-1 + b_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend component:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b_t = β(l_t - l_t-1) + (1-β)b_{t-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal component:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_t = γ(y_t - l_t) + (1-γ)s_{t-m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_t$ is the observed value at time $t, l_t$ is the level component at time $t, b_t$ is the trend component at time $t, s_t$ is the seasonal component at time $t, α, β$, and $γ$ are the smoothing parameters, and m is the number of seasonal periods in the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the components are estimated, the forecast can be generated using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecast at time $t+1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ŷ_{t+1} = l_t + b_t + s_{t+1-m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ŷ_{t+1}$ is the forecast at time $t+1$, and $s_{t+1-m}$ is the seasonal component for the next seasonal period.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Hyndman technique is a powerful tool for time series forecasting, which involves decomposing the time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components. The components are estimated using various types of exponential smoothing models, and are used to generate a forecast of the future values of the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fitting and Evaluating the model \n",
    "\n",
    "To fit the LPPL model to the Bitcoin price data, we first estimate the values of the model parameters using a nonlinear least squares regression technique. This involves minimizing the sum of the squared residuals between the observed Bitcoin prices and the predicted values from the LPPL model.\n",
    "\n",
    "After estimating the parameters, we evaluate the model's goodness of fit using several statistical measures, such as the R-squared value, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). These measures provide a quantitative assessment of how well the model fits the data, and help us compare different versions of the LPPL model with different parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we perform a residual analysis to examine the presence of any patterns or biases in the residuals, such as autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, or non-normality. If significant patterns are detected, we may need to adjust the model or include additional variables to account for these effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting and evaluating the LPPL model requires a careful balance between theoretical assumptions, statistical techniques, and practical considerations. While the LPPL model provides a powerful framework for studying financial bubbles and crashes, it is important to recognize its limitations and potential sources of uncertainty, and to interpret the results with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We presented a detailed methodology for predicting Bitcoin prices using the LPPL model. We described the data sources used to estimate the model parameters, the implementation of the LPPL model, and the incorporation of additional variables to improve its efficacy. The methodology presented in this paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers and investors seeking to understand and predict Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the LPPL model, the LPPLS model assumes that asset prices are driven by a complex system of market participants with heterogeneous beliefs, expectations, and trading strategies. In this framework, bubbles are characterized by a self-reinforcing feedback loop between bullish expectations and actual price increases, leading to an exponential rise in prices that eventually become unsustainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPLS model incorporates several key assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The market is efficient in the long run, but can be subject to temporary bubbles or crashes due to irrational behavior or exogenous shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The price of an asset is driven by a combination of fundamental factors, such as market capitalization, network activity, or social sentiment, and speculative factors, such as herd behavior or momentum trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bubbles are characterized by a log-periodic power law pattern, where the price increases with a non-linear power function of time, and the frequency of oscillation increases as the critical time of the bubble approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The LPPLS model can be used to predict the timing and magnitude of a bubble's collapse, based on the estimated critical time, the LPPL exponent, and the amplitude of the oscillations, as well as the impact of generalized error and jump-diffusion processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPLS model uses a power-law function to describe the growth of the market, and a logarithmic function to describe the oscillations in the market. The model is characterized by several parameters, including the critical time, the critical amplitude, and the critical exponent, as well as the parameters that capture the impact of generalized error and jump-diffusion processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPLS model can be represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ln(P(t))=A+B(t_c-t)^m+C(t_c-t)^m\\cos(\\omega\\ln(t_c-t)+\\phi)+D\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{-\\beta(t-t_i)}+ J(t) +\\sigma_t \\cdot z_t + \\epsilon_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPLS (Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity) model is a mathematical equation used to analyze the behavior of financial markets, particularly during speculative bubbles. It is a non-linear model that aims to capture the dynamics of price movements in financial markets by modeling the log of the asset price, denoted as $\\ln(P(t))$, as a function of time, $t$. The LPPLS model can be broken down into several components, which are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logarithmic trend component**: $A$. This component represents the long-term trend in the price of the asset and is modeled using a constant term. It captures the overall upward or downward movement of the price, irrespective of the short-term fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Power-law component**: $B(t_c-t)^m$. This component represents the power-law growth rate of the asset price leading up to the bubble peak. $B$ is a scaling factor that determines the strength of the power-law growth rate, while $t_c$ represents the time of the expected crash or bubble peak, and $m$ is a parameter that determines the curvature of the power-law growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Log-periodic component**: $C(t_c-t)^m\\cos(\\omega\\ln(t_c-t)+\\phi)$. This component represents the periodic oscillations that occur within the bubble. The term $C$ is a scaling factor that determines the amplitude of the oscillations, while $\\omega$ and $\\phi$ are parameters that control the frequency and phase of the oscillations, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Correction factor component**: $D\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{-\\beta(t-t_i)}$. This component represents the correction factor that adjusts the power-law growth rate and log-periodic oscillations to account for the effects of news and other exogenous factors. $D$ is a scaling factor that determines the strength of the correction factor, while $\\beta$ represents the decay rate of the correction factor, and $t_i$ denotes the time of each exogenous event.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Jump term component**: $J_t$ This component captures sudden, large price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Volatility term component**: $\\sigma_t \\cdot z_t$. This component captures the estimated GARCH volatility of the asset at time $t$ and is modeled as the product of a random variable $z_t$ drawn from a standard normal distribution and the estimated volatility $\\sigma_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Error term component**: $\\epsilon_t$. This component represents the random fluctuations around the model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplification and for the next sections, let's call a new variable, $y(t)$ our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = \\ln(P(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also introduce several other indicators to our LPPLS model and attempt to predict them as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The critical time\n",
    "\n",
    "In the LPPLS (Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity) model, $t_c$ represents the expected time of the crash or the bubble peak. The definition of $t_c$ in the LPPLS model is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t_c = t_m - \\ln(\\frac{\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}}{\\omega})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t_m$ is the estimated time of the maximum of the log-periodic power law, and $\\omega$ is the frequency of oscillation of the log-periodic power law.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation provides an estimate of the time of the bubble peak or crash, which is a key parameter in the LPPLS model. The value of $t_c$ can be used to predict the timing of a potential market crash or bubble peak, and to estimate the probability of such an event occurring based on the parameters of the LPPLS model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We model the rest of the component with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid components $(H_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Market-to-Metcalfe ratio power law \n",
    "\n",
    "The Market-to-Metcalfe value (MMV) is a ratio used to evaluate the network value of a cryptocurrency relative to the value of its transactions. It is calculated by dividing the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency by the product of its daily transaction volume and the average transaction value. The MMV is named after Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet and co-founder of the technology news website, TechCrunch, who proposed the concept as a way to evaluate the network effects of cryptocurrencies. The MMV is often used as an indicator of the fundamental value of a cryptocurrency and can be used to compare the valuation of different cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Market-to-Metcalfe ratio can be considered as a fundamental indicator. This is because it compares the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency to its network value, which is a fundamental metric that reflects the underlying utility and adoption of the cryptocurrency. The Metcalfe's law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users, and the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio is derived from this law to provide a measure of the network's value relative to its market capitalization. Therefore, the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio can be used to assess whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued relative to its fundamental value.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio can also be influenced by speculative factors, such as hype and FOMO (fear of missing out), which can drive up the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency without a corresponding increase in its network value. In this sense, the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio can also capture some speculative elements in the cryptocurrency market. Overall, the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio can be seen as a hybrid indicator that incorporates both fundamental and speculative factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that the interpretation of the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio as either a fundamental or speculative indicator may depend on the context and time period of analysis. For instance, during periods of high market volatility and hype, the ratio may be more influenced by speculative factors, while during periods of stability and adoption, the ratio may be more reflective of fundamental factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest two ways to incorporate the MMV to our LPPLS model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Directly incorporating the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio into the equation\n",
    "Multiply the existing LPPLS equation by the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio, denoted as $M(t)$, to obtain: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{MMVa}(t) = \\ln(P(t) \\cdot \\alpha_0 M(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach involves directly incorporating the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio into the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Market-to-Metcalfe ratio as a separate variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio as an additional independent variable in the LPPLS equation. The equation becomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{MMVb}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_0 \\ln(M(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach treats the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio as a separate variable, which may allow for more nuanced analysis of its impact on the cryptocurrency price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamental components $(F_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This component captures the underlying value of Bitcoin based on its fundamentals, such as adoption rates, transaction volume, and hash rate. To simplify the model, we will assume that the fundamental component is a weighted average of these factors, with each factor given a weight based on its importance. Let $F_t$ denote the fundamental component at time $t$, and let $X_i$ denote the $i$-th fundamental factor. Then the formula for $F_t$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(t) = w_1X_1 + w_2X_2 + ... + w_nX_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_F = y(t) + F(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_i$ is the weight assigned to the $i$-th fundamental factor. The weights can be determined using regression analysis or other statistical methods, and should reflect the relative importance of each factor in determining Bitcoin's underlying value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of the fundamental components include the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hash rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash rate refers to the computational power of the Bitcoin network, which is used to mine new blocks and process transactions. A higher hash rate indicates a more secure network and a greater demand for mining, which can drive up the Bitcoin price. We can incorporate hash rate into the LPPLS model using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{HR}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_9 \\ln(\\text{HR}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_{HR}$ is the logarithmic trend component with hash rate, and $\\alpha$ is a coefficient that captures the impact of hash rate on the Bitcoin price.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transaction volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction volume measures the total number of Bitcoin transactions over a given period. An increase in transaction volume can signify a growing user adoption and network usage, which can lead to an increase in demand for Bitcoin and a higher price. We can include transaction volume into the LPPLS model using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{TV}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_{10} \\ln(\\text{TV}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_{TV}$ is the logarithmic trend component with transaction volume, and $\\alpha$ is a coefficient that captures the impact of transaction volume on the Bitcoin price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speculative components $(S_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This component captures the influence of market sentiment, momentum, and other speculative factors on Bitcoin's price. To simplify the model, we will assume that the speculative component is a weighted average of these factors, with each factor given a weight based on its importance. Let $S_t$ denote the speculative component at time $t$, and let $Y_i$ denote the $i$-th speculative factor. Then the formula for $S_t$ is:\n",
    "$$S(t) = v_1Y_1 + v_2Y_2 + ... + v_mY_m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_S = y(t) + S_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_i$ is the weight assigned to the $i$-th speculative factor. The weights can be determined using regression analysis or other statistical methods, and should reflect the relative importance of each factor in determining Bitcoin's price in the short term.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risk premium\n",
    "The risk premium is the difference between the expected return on an asset and the risk-free rate of return. This concept was first introduced by Nobel Prize laureate Eugene Fama. The LPPLS model with risk premium can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{RP}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_2 (\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(\\text{RP}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{RP}$ is the risk-free rate of return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why the indicators are added in the following way: $\\alpha(\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(\\text{risk-free rate}))$ is to adjust for the risk associated with investing in Bitcoin compared to a risk-free asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural logarithm of the asset price, $\\ln(P(t))$, is used to transform the price data into a log-scale, which makes it easier to analyze and model non-linear patterns. The logarithm of the risk-free rate, $\\ln(\\text{risk-free rate})$, is used as a benchmark to compare the returns of Bitcoin against a risk-free asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the two logarithms, $(\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(\\text{risk-free rate}))$, represents the excess return of Bitcoin compared to the risk-free asset. The excess return is then multiplied by a scaling factor, $\\alpha$, which represents the risk premium associated with investing in Bitcoin. The risk premium is a measure of the extra return that investors require for taking on the additional risk of investing in Bitcoin compared to a risk-free asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By including the risk premium in the model, we are accounting for the additional risk that investors are taking on when investing in Bitcoin. This can help to provide a more accurate prediction of future Bitcoin prices by taking into account the level of risk associated with investing in the asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option-implied volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "Option-implied volatility is a measure of the market's expectation of future volatility, derived from the prices of options on the asset. This indicator was developed by Robert Engle, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2003. The LPPLS model with option-implied volatility can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{OIV} = y(t) + \\alpha_1 \\ln(\\text{OIV}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a coefficient that captures the impact of option-implied volatility on the asset price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moving averages\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving averages are a popular technical indicator used to identify trends in financial markets. They were first introduced by Nobel Prize laureate Charles Dow. The LPPLS model with moving averages can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{MA}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_3 (\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(MA_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{MA}(t)$ is the moving average of the asset price up to time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Momentum indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum indicators are used to identify trends in financial markets by comparing current prices to historical prices. They were first introduced by Nobel Prize laureate Louis Bachelier. The LPPLS model with momentum indicators can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{MI}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_4 (\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(\\text{MI}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{momentum indicator}(t)$ is the momentum indicator of the asset price up to time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum is a measure of an asset's recent price trend, calculated by taking the difference between the current price and the price $n$ periods ago. This indicator was developed by Robert Shiller, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013. The LPPLS model with momentum can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{MOM}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_5 (\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(\\text{MOM}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $MOM$ is the momentum over the previous $n$ periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Relative Strength Index (RSI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The RSI is a technical indicator used to analyze the momentum of Bitcoin's price movements. It was developed by J. Welles Wilder, a mechanical engineer and technical analyst. The RSI ranges from 0 to 100 and is calculated by comparing the average gains and losses of Bitcoin's price over a specified period. The mathematical equation for RSI integration into the LPPLS model can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{RSI}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_6 \\ln(\\text{RSI}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incorporating NVT Ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "The NVT (Network Value to Transactions) ratio can be added to the LPPL model as an additional explanatory variable that captures the relationship between the network value of a cryptocurrency and its transaction volume. It was proposed by Willy Woo, a Bitcoin analyst. The NVT ratio is calculated as the Bitcoin market capitalization divided by the daily on-chain transaction volume. This can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{NVT}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_7 \\cdot \\ln(NVT_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $NVT_t$ is the NVT ratio of the asset at time $t$, and $\\gamma$ is the estimated coefficient of the NVT ratio variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine the overall sentiment of market participants towards Bitcoin. It was proposed by Shiller, an Nobel Prize laureate economist and Bo Pang and Lillian Lee, computer science researchers. Sentiment analysis can be performed using machine learning algorithms to analyze news articles, social media posts, and other sources of information. The mathematical equation for sentiment analysis integration into the LPPLS model can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{S}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_8 \\ln(\\text{S}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fear and Greed Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fear and Greed Index is a sentiment indicator that measures the emotions and sentiments of market participants towards Bitcoin. A high Fear and Greed Index score can indicate that the market is in a state of greed, and a low score can suggest a state of fear. We can incorporate Fear and Greed Index into the LPPLS model using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{FG}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_{11} \\ln(\\text{FG}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_{FG}$ is the logarithmic trend component with Fear and Greed Index, and $\\alpha$ is a coefficient that captures the impact of Fear and Greed Index on the Bitcoin price.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Trends is a tool that allows us to measure the relative search volume for Bitcoin on Google over time. A higher Google Trends score can indicate a growing interest and awareness of Bitcoin, which can translate into a higher demand for the cryptocurrency and a higher price. We can integrate Google Trends into the LPPLS model using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{GT}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_{12} \\ln(\\text{GT}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_{GT}$ is the logarithmic trend component with Google Trends, and $\\alpha$ is a coefficient that captures the impact of Google Trends on the Bitcoin price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating additional variables into the LPPLS model equation can improve its accuracy and predictability. The market capitalization, NVT ratio, and social media sentiment are all important factors that can influence the Bitcoin price. By incorporating these variables into the LPPL model equation, we can develop a more comprehensive and accurate prediction model for Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further enhance the predictive power of the LPPL model, it is necessary to consider a broader range of predictors beyond those discussed in the paper. While incorporating market capitalization, NVT ratio, social media sentiment, and technical analysis indicators can be useful, there are other predictors that could be valuable in predicting Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such predictor is mining difficulty, which measures the computational power required to mine Bitcoin. Mining difficulty is adjusted periodically to ensure that new Bitcoin blocks are added to the blockchain at a steady rate. Increases in mining difficulty indicate that more computational power is required to mine Bitcoin, which can lead to higher transaction fees and longer processing times. This can, in turn, affect the demand for Bitcoin and potentially impact its price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another predictor to consider is the number of active Bitcoin addresses. The number of active addresses reflects the level of activity on the Bitcoin network and can provide insights into the adoption and usage of Bitcoin. Higher levels of activity could indicate increasing interest and adoption of Bitcoin, which may drive up its price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating these additional predictors into the LPPLS model equation can potentially improve its predictive power and provide more accurate forecasts of Bitcoin prices. However, it is important to note that the relationship between these predictors and Bitcoin prices is complex and multifaceted. Therefore, careful analysis and modeling are necessary to fully understand their impact on Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "While the LPPL model has shown efficacy in predicting Bitcoin prices, the paper could benefit from more rigorous testing to validate the model's accuracy. For instance, we conduct out-of-sample testing or compare the LPPL model's performance to other commonly used models, such as ARIMA or GARCH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-sample testing involves using data that is not included in the model's development to evaluate the model's predictive ability. This can be done by splitting the data into two parts, using one part for training the model and the other for testing the model's performance. By doing this, we assess the model's ability to generalize to new data and not overfit to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the LPPL model's performance to other commonly used models, such as ARIMA or GARCH, can provide a benchmark for evaluating the model's performance. This can be done by comparing the accuracy of the models in predicting Bitcoin prices over a specific time frame. This type of analysis can help identify which model performs better under certain market conditions and can provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the we conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the model. This can be done by changing the model's parameters or assumptions and observing the effect on the model's performance. Sensitivity analysis can help identify the key drivers of the model and assess the impact of different scenarios on the model's predictions.\n",

    "Overall, conducting more rigorous testing can help validate the LPPL model's accuracy and assess its usefulness in predicting Bitcoin prices. This can provide investors and researchers with greater confidence in the model's ability to forecast future price movements and make informed investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPL model has shown efficacy in predicting Bitcoin prices, but it is not without limitations. One potential limitation is that it assumes market sentiment remains constant over time, which may not always be the case. The LPPL model is also a complex mathematical model that requires significant computational power to run, which may limit its accessibility to individual investors. Moreover, while the LPPL model has been successful in predicting past price movements, it is not a foolproof method for predicting future price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, the authors collected historical Bitcoin price data from multiple sources and incorporated additional variables, such as market capitalization, NVT ratio, social media sentiment, and technical analysis indicators, to improve the LPPL model's efficacy. They used a rolling window approach to calibrate the model to the Bitcoin price data and estimated the model parameters using historical Bitcoin price data. However, the paper could benefit from more rigorous testing to validate the model's accuracy, such as out-of-sample testing or comparing the LPPL model's performance to other commonly used models, such as ARIMA or GARCH.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPL model has limitations, but its effectiveness in predicting Bitcoin prices can be improved by incorporating additional variables and using a rolling window approach to calibrate the model to the Bitcoin price data. The methodology presented in this paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers and investors seeking to understand and predict Bitcoin prices. However, it is important to conduct thorough research and exercise caution when investing in Bitcoin or any other asset, as the uncertainties associated with predicting Bitcoin prices are many.\n",

    "## Ethical implications\n",
    "\n",
    "While the paper focuses primarily on the technical aspects of predicting Bitcoin prices, it may be worthwhile to consider the ethical implications of this work. We discuss how the use of predictive models may impact the cryptocurrency market or how their work may be used by investors to make decisions. Below are some potential ethical implications that we could consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact on Market Efficiency**: One of the key assumptions of efficient market theory is that market prices reflect all available information. However, if investors start using predictive models to make investment decisions, they may be able to exploit market inefficiencies and earn abnormal profits. This could lead to a breakdown in market efficiency, as prices would no longer reflect all available information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unintended Consequences**: Predictive models are not infallible, and there is always a risk of unintended consequences. For example, if investors start relying too heavily on predictive models, they may be more likely to engage in herd behavior, leading to price bubbles or crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unequal Access**: If predictive models become widely adopted in the cryptocurrency market, it could create an uneven playing field for investors. Investors who have access to better predictive models or more advanced technology may be able to earn abnormal profits at the expense of less well-informed investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Privacy Concerns**: we also consider the potential privacy concerns associated with the use of predictive models. For example, if investors start using social media sentiment data to make investment decisions, it could raise questions about the privacy of social media users and their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manipulation**: Predictive models could also be used to manipulate the market. For example, if a large investor or group of investors starts using a predictive model to make investment decisions, they could influence the price of Bitcoin and potentially earn abnormal profits at the expense of other investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ethical implications of using predictive models to predict Bitcoin prices are complex and multifaceted. While we may not be able to address all of these issues in detail, it would be worthwhile for them to acknowledge and discuss the potential ethical implications of their work. This could help ensure that investors and researchers are aware of the risks associated with predictive modeling and can take steps to mitigate these risks.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we presents a comprehensive scientific methodology for predicting Bitcoin prices using the Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model. The LPPL model, developed by Didier Sornette and his team, is based on the concept of critical points in complex systems and has been recognized for its efficacy in predicting Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study provides an in-depth analysis of the LPPL model and its key components, including the critical time and critical amplitude, and describes how to estimate the model parameters using historical price data. Additionally, the study discusses the additional findings made by Nobel Prize laureates to improve the model's accuracy, such as the incorporation of market capitalization, Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio, social media sentiment, and technical analysis indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study compares the LPPL model to other models in predicting Bitcoin market behavior and discusses the limitations of the LPPL model in predicting Bitcoin market behavior. The study also investigates the effect of various exogenous variables on Bitcoin market behavior, such as the network value and macroeconomic indicators, and provides a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin markets that considers multiple aspects of market behavior and compares Bitcoin to other digital currencies and financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study's findings have important implications for investors and policymakers. By improving our understanding of Bitcoin market behavior and our ability to predict its price movements, we can better manage the risks associated with investing in digital currencies. Furthermore, policymakers can use the findings to develop regulations that promote transparency and stability in cryptocurrency markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the study's strengths is its methodology, which provides a valuable resource for researchers and investors seeking to understand and predict Bitcoin prices. However, the study is not without limitations. The LPPL model has limitations in predicting Bitcoin market behavior, and further research is needed to investigate the factors that affect Bitcoin market behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we make a significant contribution to the growing literature on cryptocurrencies by presenting a comprehensive scientific methodology for predicting Bitcoin prices using the LPPL model. The study's findings have important implications for investors and policymakers and provide a valuable resource for researchers and investors seeking to understand and predict Bitcoin prices. Further research is needed to investigate the factors that affect Bitcoin market behavior, and to improve our ability to predict its price movements.\n",
