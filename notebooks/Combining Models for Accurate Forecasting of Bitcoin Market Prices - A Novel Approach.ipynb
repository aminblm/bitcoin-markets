    "\n",
    "Boulouma A., 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid growth of cryptocurrency markets has created a need for accurate forecasting of Bitcoin prices, which can have significant impacts on global financial systems. In this study, we aim to determine the combination of models that yields the highest predictive power for forecasting Bitcoin market prices. Our research question is whether combining multiple models can lead to more accurate predictions than individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proposed research is of significant importance as it provides a novel approach to forecasting Bitcoin market prices, which can inform investment decisions and help mitigate financial risks. We aim to utilize several well-known models, including the Jump-diffusion models, Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) Models, Bayesian Time Series Analysis, Empirical Asset Pricing, as well as Robert Shiller's theories of Speculative Asset Prices and Narrative Economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research methodology involves the use of historical data on Bitcoin prices, as well as statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to determine the most effective combination of models. We will compare the predictive power of combined models with that of individual models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected outcomes of our research are the identification of the optimal combination of models for accurate forecasting of Bitcoin market prices, which can inform financial decision-making and contribute to the advancement of cryptocurrency research. Our study will also provide insights into the effectiveness of combining different models for forecasting other financial assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decade, the world has witnessed a proliferation of cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin has emerged as the undisputed leader in this rapidly evolving market. The growth of Bitcoin has attracted the attention of investors, economists, and financial analysts worldwide, as its volatile price fluctuations have sparked debates about the potential of this asset class. The complex nature of Bitcoin, coupled with its decentralized and unregulated framework, makes forecasting the future of Bitcoin prices an arduous task. The need for accurate forecasting has become increasingly essential as the financial industry and policymakers grapple with the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate forecasting of Bitcoin prices is vital because it provides insights into market trends and enables traders to make informed decisions. Forecasting models can help predict future prices by analyzing past prices and identifying patterns and trends in the market. These models have become increasingly popular in the financial industry, and several forecasting models have been developed to predict Bitcoin prices. However, no model has been able to achieve high predictive accuracy consistently, and the search for a reliable model remains a challenging and pressing research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, the importance of identifying the best combination of models that yields the highest predictive power for forecasting Bitcoin market prices cannot be overstated. The Nobel Prize-winning research works in finance, such as Jump-diffusion models, Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) Models, Bayesian Time Series Analysis, and Empirical Asset Pricing, provide a theoretical foundation for modeling financial markets. These models offer insights into the behavior of financial markets and can be used to forecast future prices. The recent works of Robert Shiller, such as \"Speculative Asset Prices\" and \"Narrative Economics,\" have provided new perspectives on how human behavior influences financial markets and have opened new avenues for research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this proposal aims to investigate the effectiveness of different combinations of models in predicting Bitcoin market prices accurately. The research will draw on the theoretical foundations provided by the Nobel Prize-winning research works and other relevant academic literature to construct various models. The methodology will involve testing different combinations of these models to determine which combination yields the highest predictive accuracy. The expected outcomes will provide insights into the best combination of models that can be used to forecast Bitcoin market prices accurately. This research will provide valuable inputs for traders, policymakers, and investors who seek to make informed decisions based on accurate price predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting Bitcoin market prices has been a subject of extensive research due to its rapidly growing popularity and volatility. Several studies have focused on developing models and techniques to predict future prices with a high degree of accuracy. In this literature review, we aim to provide an overview of the existing research on forecasting Bitcoin market prices, as well as a review of the models and techniques used in previous studies.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our study aims to build upon these existing models and techniques to develop a more accurate forecasting model for Bitcoin market prices. We will use a combination of the models discussed above and other techniques to create a hybrid model with a high degree of accuracy in predicting Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question and Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research question**: How can we accurately predict the price of Bitcoin at $t+1$? What are the best models to do so? What are the best model combinations to do so?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: Combining multiple models leads to more accurate predictions for Bitcoin market prices than individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data collection and analysis methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical analysis and machine learning techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of predictive power of combined models vs individual models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the models used in the study\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we employ various models to analyze and forecast Bitcoin prices. These models include the Jump-diffusion model, the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model, Bayesian Time Series Analysis, Empirical Asset Pricing models, Narrative Economics, and Speculative Asset Prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DSGE model, developed by Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott in 1997, is a macroeconomic model that describes the behavior of the economy as a whole. It assumes that economic agents are rational and forward-looking and that economic fluctuations are caused by various shocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian Time Series Analysis, introduced by Thomas Sargent in 2008, is a statistical approach that uses Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of a time series model. This method allows us to incorporate prior knowledge into the model and update the parameters as new data becomes available. Bayesian Time Series Analysis has gained popularity in forecasting Bitcoin prices due to its ability to handle complex time series data and provide reliable estimates of the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical Asset Pricing models, developed by Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen in 2011, analyze the relationship between risk and return in financial markets. These models use various factors, such as market capitalization, book-to-market ratio, and momentum, to explain the variation in asset returns. Empirical Asset Pricing models have been applied to analyze the risk and return of Bitcoin and have been found to explain a significant portion of the variation in Bitcoin returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Narrative Economics and Speculative Asset Prices, introduced by Robert Shiller in 2017 and 2005, respectively, are approaches that focus on the role of narratives and psychology in financial markets. Narrative Economics uses data from sources such as social media and news articles to analyze the stories and narratives that influence market behavior. Speculative Asset Prices, on the other hand, focus on the psychological factors that drive market bubbles and crashes. These models have been applied to analyze the behavior of Bitcoin prices and have provided insights into the role of narratives and psychology in Bitcoin market dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this study employs a range of models, from traditional finance models such as the Jump-diffusion model and Empirical Asset Pricing models to more recent approaches such as Bayesian Time Series Analysis, Narrative Economics, and Speculative Asset Prices. These models provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of Bitcoin prices and enable us to forecast future market trends with greater accuracy.\n",

    "### 1976, Jump-diffusion models, Robert Merton (Nobel Prize 1997) \n",
    "\n",
    "Jump diffusion models for Bitcoin prices forecasting can be formulated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $S_t$ be the Bitcoin price at time $t$, and let $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ be the constant drift and volatility of the price process, respectively. Additionally, let $\\lambda$ and $\\delta$ be the intensity and magnitude of the jump process, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the stochastic process $S_t$ can be modeled as a jump diffusion process given by the following stochastic differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    dS_t = \\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t + S_t dJ_t\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process and $J_t$ is a Poisson process with jump sizes distributed according to a stable distribution with location parameter $\\delta$ and scale parameter $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters of the model, $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, $\\lambda$, and $\\delta$, can be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation or other statistical methods. The resulting model can then be used to forecast future Bitcoin prices and estimate the associated uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formulation, the variables are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S_t$: the Bitcoin price at time $t$\n",
    "- $\\mu$: the constant drift of the price process\n",
    "- $\\sigma$: the constant volatility of the price process\n",
    "- $\\lambda$: the intensity of the jump process\n",
    "- $\\delta$: the magnitude of the jump process\n",
    "- $W_t$: a standard Wiener process\n",
    "- $J_t$: a Poisson process with jump sizes distributed according to a stable distribution with location parameter \n",
    "$\\delta$ and scale parameter $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model can't make prediction on t+1 based on t only, the jump diffusion model for Bitcoin prices forecasting is not a time-series model that only uses past data at time t to make predictions for time t+1. The model includes stochastic elements that are not predictable from past data alone. Instead, the model uses a combination of past data and random jumps to make predictions, so it requires current information on the state of the market to predict the price at time t+1.\n",

The error term is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\\beta_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 10^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior distributions for the model parameters can be estimated using Bayesian inference. This involves updating the prior distributions based on the observed data to obtain the posterior distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\beta_0, \\beta_1|\\textbf{y}, \\textbf{x}) \\propto p(\\textbf{y}|\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\textbf{x})p(\\beta_0)p(\\beta_1)$$\n",

    "where $\\textbf{y}$ represents the vector of Bitcoin prices, $\\textbf{x}$ represents the matrix of economic indicators, and $p(\\textbf{y}|\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\textbf{x})$ is the likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the posterior distributions for the model parameters have been estimated, they can be used to make predictions for future Bitcoin prices. This involves simulating from the posterior distributions to obtain a distribution of future Bitcoin prices:\n",
