# Litterature review  key findings on Bitcoin Asset Pricing
Amin Boulouma, 2023


## Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
Satoshi Nakamoto
### Key findings

* The paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" proposed a decentralized digital currency system called Bitcoin, which enables electronic transactions without relying on trusted third parties such as financial institutions. 
* Bitcoin is a decentralized system that relies on cryptographic techniques to enable secure transactions and prevent fraud.
* Bitcoin uses a public ledger called the blockchain to record transactions and maintain the integrity of the system.
* Transactions in the Bitcoin system are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded on the blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that prevents double-spending and fraud.
* The Bitcoin system incentivizes network nodes to verify transactions through a reward system that distributes newly minted bitcoins to nodes that successfully solve complex mathematical problems.
* The paper also discusses potential future developments for the Bitcoin system, including the use of micropayments and smart contracts.

## The New Financial Order, risk in the 21st century
Rober Shiller
### Key findings
* Economic gains from technological progress don't guarantee that more people will lead good lives
* Enormous economic insecurity and income inequality persist despite technological advances
* New risk management ideas can enable the management of a vast array of present and future risks, limiting the downside effects of capitalism's "creative destruction"
* A new financial infrastructure that utilizes financial inventions to protect people against systemic risks can secure the wealth of nations and preserve economic gains that sustain people globally
* The proposed infrastructure would permit people to pursue their dreams with greater confidence, encouraging growth-oriented individuals to convert their intellectual energies into useful goods and services for society.
* Historical economic thinkers were limited by the state of relevant risk management principles of their day
* Recent advances in financial theory, information technology, and psychology allow for new inventions for managing technological and economic risks inherent in capitalism that could not have been envisioned by past thinkers
* The New Financial Order is about applying risk management technology to the major problems of our lives to promote wealth
* The book presents steps that can realistically be taken to make our lives better
* The book does not propose a finished blueprint for the future but rather a new direction that will inevitably be improved by future experimentation, innovation, and advances in financial theory, relevant risk-related information, and social scientists' ability to design user-friendly techniques.
* The author began working on the book in 1997 as a culmination of years of thinking and writing about how to improve institutions for dealing with risks, both to individuals and to society.
* The book was interrupted in 1999 by the author's book, Irrational Exuberance, which addressed the misperception and mismanagement of long-term risks in the stock market and society's exaggerated importance attached to it.
* Psychological framing is essential for successful risk management institutions.
* Innovators need to go beyond incremental improvements and think of major changes outside consumers' habitual frames of reference and promote these ideas long-term.
* Public acceptance of risk management contracts can be enhanced by framing them as enlightened actions individuals undertake freely and reflecting a common consensus before outcomes are known.
* Robust psychological framing requires choosing the right names and sensible designs that stand the test of time.
* Intergenerational social security must be designed as a device that balances the real and fundamental risks of generations, and international risk management contracts must be arranged between nations facing different risks.
* Proper psychological framing ensures that a new financial order addresses fundamental economic risks, affecting people's welfare and is based on solid principles.
* Fundamental experimentation is necessary because businesses do not know all the ramifications of economic inventions, and many experiments' probability of success is low.
* Governments and businesses can sponsor experimentation by offering research grants and patents to evaluate outcomes, and studying financial experiments can provide valuable insight.

## Speculative Asset Prices
Robert SHiller
### Key findings
* Long-term asset prices such as stock and home prices are driven by various factors and change from time to time.
* The discourse in the profession is divided between rationality and behavioral finance, which considers alternative psychological, sociological, and epidemiological factors that affect prices.
* Statistical methods have allowed for the identification of sources of price volatility in the stock and housing markets.
* The evidence supports the behavioral finance revolution in financial thought in recent decades.
* Financial technology holds a promise for the future of finance, despite the skepticism of financial institutions.
* The rationality of markets is a precursor to the talk of financial technology, as it underpins the possibilities that new technology offers.
* The markets have already been "human-factors-engineered" to function remarkably well, but further innovation is necessary to improve the functioning of these markets.

## Large financial crashes
Didier Sornette, Anders Johansen, 1997
### Key findings
* Large stock market crashes are analogous to critical points studied in statistical physics with log-periodic correction to scaling.
* The authors extend their previous renormalization group model of stock market prices prior to and after crashes by including the first non-linear correction.
* The extension predicts the existence of a log-frequency shift over time in the log-periodic oscillations prior to a crash.
* The theory is tested on the two largest historical crashes of the century, the October 1929 and October 1987 crashes, by fitting the stock market index over an interval of 8 years prior to the crashes.
* The good quality of the fits and the consistency of the parameter values obtained from the two crashes support the theory that crashes have their origin in the collective "crowd" behavior of many interacting agents.
* The value of the exponent c and the log-frequency 0 for the two great crashes are quite close to each other, indicating universality of the exponent predicted from the renormalization group theory.

## Crashes As Critical Points
ANDERS JOHANSEN, OLIVIER LEDOIT, and DIDIER SORNETTE, 2000

### Key findings
* The model assumes that a crash may be caused by local self-reinforcing imitation between noise traders.
* The "critical" point is the point at which the tendency for noise traders to imitate their nearest neighbors increases up to a certain point, causing a crash.
* The hazard rate is the probability per unit time that the crash will happen in the next instant if it has not happened yet.
* Traders remain invested provided they are compensated by a higher rate of growth of the bubble for taking the risk of a crash.
* The model distinguishes between the end of the bubble and the time of the crash, with the date of the crash being random.
* The theoretical death of the bubble is not the time of the crash because the crash could happen at any time before.
* There is a finite probability of attaining the end of the bubble without a crash.
* The model predicts the presence of certain critical log-periodic patterns in pre-crash prices, associated with the deterministic components of the bubble mechanism.
* Empirical evidence shows that these patterns were present before the crashes of 1929, 1962, and 1987 on Wall Street and the 1997 crash on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
* These results are compared with statistical tests on synthetic data


## The subprime solution : how today's global financial crisis happened, and what to do about it
Robert Shiller
### Key findings

* The subprime crisis was caused by the deflating of a speculative bubble in the US housing market that began in 2006 and cascaded across many other countries.
* The forces unleashed by the subprime crisis will run rampant for years, threatening collateral damage.
* The crisis has set in motion fundamental societal changes that affect consumer habits, values, and relatedness to each other.
* Allowing these destructive changes to proceed unimpeded could cause damage not only to the economy but also to the social fabric for decades to come.
* John Maynard Keynes resigned in protest from the British delegation at Versailles and predicted that the Treaty of Versailles would result in disaster. The disaster came about as intense resentment and, a generation later, World War II.
* The housing bubble that created the subprime crisis ultimately grew as big as it did because we as a society do not understand or know how to deal with speculative bubbles.


## A systematic review of the bubble dynamics of cryptocurrency prices
Nikolaos KyriazisStephanos PapadamouShaen CorbetFrehen et al., Corsi and Sornette, Vogel and Werner, West, Diba and Grossman, 2020
### Key findings

* Bubble formation has received different definitions, but a simple one is systematic deviations of the market value from the fundamental value of the asset.
* Such deviations cannot be explained based on any of the fundamentals, but rather depend on combinations of the rationality or not of agents and markets.
* Bubbles consist of a run-up phase that leads to formation of bubbles and imbalances, and a crisis phase where accumulated risk materializes, and the crisis breaks out.
* Asset markets are directed by mercurial investors acting on the basis of short-lived enthusiasms and bubbles.
* Bubbles are dramatic price increases which lead to bursting.
* Tulipmania, the South Sea bubble, and the collapse of the Mississippi Company are the three most important historic bubbles.
* During Tulipmania, a single bulb could be sold for many years' salary, and even common tulip varieties skyrocketed with approximately 2000% increases in prices within a month.
* The South Sea bubble was generated by attracting investors from France by promising enormous profits in the French colonies in North America, but there was no prospect of significant trade and profits.
* The Mississippi bubble was the result of Compagnie d'Occident created by John Law, which had the monopoly power over the French tobacco and African slave trades, and collapsed when inflation rose too high because of over-issuing of public debt.
* The existing literature on detecting bubbles is rooted in the asset pricing model of Lucas Jr. (1978), with Blanchard and Watson (1982) arguing that bubbles can follow many types of processes, and Shiller et al. (1984) supporting that social movements and habits in specific time periods are responsible for increases in asset prices.
* Tirole (1985) reveals that there are three conditions for bubble creation: durability, scarcity, and common beliefs. * He distinguishes between the financial bubble, which depends on market price, and the real bubble that is established by the fundamentals of the market.
* Diba and Grossman (1988) argue that stock prices do not contain explosive price bubbles, and Froot and Obstfeld (1989) focused on rational intrinsic bubbles dependent only on dividends, finding evidence in favour of bubbles in the US stock market that are difficult to be explained by alternative models.
* Gurkaynak (2008) finds that asset bubble tests cannot offer adequate information about the existence or not of bubbles, and when bubble detection tests indicate the existence of a bubble, we could be far from certain that this bubble exists.
* Rational bubbles appear when asset prices keep rising due to investors' beliefs that there will be a possibility to sell the overvalued asset at a higher price in the future. Intrinsic rational bubbles are formed when investors systematically and continuously conduct wrong estimations of asset fundamentals, while extrinsic rational bubbles occur when rational investors have to confront large levels of uncertainty concerning the economic environment.
* No consensus exists as regards the tracing and measurement of price bubbles. Among others, there have been four principal alternative approaches in order to define bubbles: the asset-pricing approach, the sigmoid curve approach, the fundamental-value approach, and the mispricing approach.
* Empirical papers investigate bubble price dynamics in cryptocurrency markets, with emphasis on Bitcoin.
* Cryptocurrencies contain pricing inefficiencies, persistence, correlation or isolation from other traded assets, news response, derivative development, contagion effects, evidence of price clustering, pricing bubbles, regulatory ambiguity, and exceptional levels of both complex and uncomplex fraud.
* Concern placed on pricing efficiency, market dynamics, and the potential presence of a pricing bubble.
* Marginal cost of production, Metcalfe's Law, portfolio theory, search intensity and gold returns, liquidity risks, Tether issuance, under-pricing of ICOs, and the process of banning Bitcoin are investigated.
* Interactions between cryptocurrencies and other more traditional financial markets is a key area of research.
* Scepticism exists regarding the potential for illegality and malpractice, with estimates that $76 billion of illegal activity per year involve Bitcoin.
* Companies attempting to take advantage of ‘crypto-exuberance’ must be considered.
* Fundamental issue of what exactly is the price of one unit of cryptocurrency remains.
* Alternative estimation frameworks are used to detect price bubbles in Bitcoin markets
Bouoiyour et al. (2014) find that bubble behavior in Bitcoin markets exists, and the attractiveness to Bitcoin influences the Bitcoin Price Index at short* and long-run frequencies with a cyclical nexus that is not of a stable length
* Bouoiyour et al. (2016) show that the speculative character of Bitcoin and the long-term fundamentals are major determinants of fluctuations in Bitcoin quotes
* Cheah and Fry (2015) find evidence of a bubble character in the Bitcoin market, and the random walk hypothesis is rejected
* Fry and Cheah (2016) reveal that Ripple is over-priced in relation to Bitcoin and that the former exerted a spillover influence to the latter, exacerbating recent price falls in Bitcoin
* Holub and Johnson (2019) show that the Bitcoin bubble exerted different effects on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P) market, depending on the currency and country
* Chen and Hafner (2019) find that sentiment-induced bubbles exist in markets of digital currencies, and volatility is higher during bubble periods
* Corbet et al. (2020) provide evidence that after the KodakCoin announcement, the connection between Kodak and the DJIA rendered weaker, but the relation of Kodak with Bitcoin was significantly fortified.


## Cryptocurrencies as financial bubbles: The case of Bitcoin
Julian GeuderHarald KinatederNiklas F. Wagner, 2019
### Key findings

* Bubble behavior is a common and recurring characteristic of Bitcoin prices.
December 6, 2017 is identified as a critical time point after which neither approach provides evidence of ongoing bubble behavior.
* Cryptocurrencies offer an ideal setting for testing speculative behavior, and Bitcoin's price increase in December 2017 may have been accompanied by the "fear of missing out" of many private investors.
* The Phillips et al. (2015) PSY methodology and the log-periodic power law (LPPL) approach by Filimonov and Sornette (2013) are used to identify and analyze bubble behavior in Bitcoin prices.
* Both methodologies identify the existence of bubble periods in Bitcoin prices.
* The PSY model identifies several sub-periods of bubble behavior, with three sub-periods occurring in 2017.
* The LPPL model fits Bitcoin prices until the last identified critical point in time, after which further bubble behavior is not identified.
* The rational bubble view and other reasons and determinants may help explain Bitcoin price behavior, including global monetary environment for fiat currencies, institutional changes, the use of Bitcoin for web-based transactions, governments restricting the use of cryptocurrencies, and other regulatory changes.
* Future research may analyze these issues in more detail.


## Negative bubbles and shocks in cryptocurrency markets
John Fry, Eng-Tuck Cheah, 2016
### Key findings


* The paper develops models for financial bubbles and crashes using tools and techniques from statistical physics and mathematical finance
* The models allow for a probabilistic and statistical formulation of econophysics models, which can be applied to cryptocurrency markets
* The paper contributes to wider debates in econophysics, such as probabilistic and statistical approaches and the development of links with mainstream financial models
* Econophysics has been used to address a wide range of practical problems in finance and economics, including speculative bubbles and high-frequency trading
* Cryptocurrency markets present legal, regulatory, and ethical challenges and have been extremely volatile
* The paper develops an econophysics model for bubbles and crashes that can be fitted to empirical financial data
* Negative bubbles are found in cryptocurrency markets, and evidence is found of a spillover effect from Ripple to Bitcoin
* The paper develops a model to independently verify the impact of putative market shocks upon Bitcoin
* Results suggest that cryptocurrency markets are complex and often misunderstood by academics and practitioners
* Despite being a fast-moving and unconventional area, there is a wealth of statistical information available about Bitcoin and other digital currencies that renders academic study of the area entirely possible.
* Coinmarketcap.com is a key data source used in previous academic studies and provides data about listed coins such as price, available supply, trade volume, and market capitalization.
* In addition to providing timely information, coins listed on coinmarketcap.com must also satisfy rigorous assessment criteria, including being genuinely tradable and satisfying a transparency requirement.
* It remains unclear whether Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies should be seen as an alternative currency or as a speculative asset, with some arguing that Bitcoin should be seen as a speculative commodity rather than a currency.
* Bitcoin's prices appear to be particularly susceptible to market sentiments and dramatic boom-bust episodes, undermining the role that Bitcoin might play as a store of value.
* The long-term sustainability of Bitcoin has also come under scrutiny, with some authors seeing the lack of a centralized governance body as an essential weakness, and concerns raised that its design flaws may ultimately make Bitcoin vulnerable to competing altcoins in the long-term.
* Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies raise several important ethical issues, including concerns that the anonymity endowed by cryptocurrencies may encourage illegal activities, cybersecurity worries, and fears over the continued ability of governments to raise taxes.


## Dragon-Kings, Black Swans and the Prediction of Crises
Didier Sornette
### Key findings
* The concept of "dragon-kings" is developed to refer to meaningful outliers that coexist with power laws in the distribution of event sizes in a variety of systems.
* Dragon-kings reveal the existence of self-organization mechanisms that are not apparent from the distribution of their smaller siblings.
* The presence of a phase transition, bifurcation, catastrophe, or tipping point is often associated with dragon-kings, and their emergence can provide clues for diagnosing a system's maturation towards a crisis.
* Catastrophes and crises occur more often than predicted or expected from observations of small, medium, and large events.
* The use of a systemic, complex system, and multidisciplinary approach is growing in importance in most scientific disciplines and in the management of modern engineering devices and business management.
* Dragon-kings exhibit a degree of predictability due to their association with mechanisms expressed differently than for other events.
* A variety of concrete examples is described, especially on the application of the diagnostic of financial bubbles and the prediction of their demise.


## Bubble diagnosis and prediction of the 2005–2007 and 2008–2009, Chinese stock market bubbles
Didier Sornette
### Key findings

* The log-periodic power law (LPPL) model was developed to detect bubbles by combining economic theory of rational expectation bubbles, behavioral finance on imitation and herding of investors and traders, and the mathematical and statistical physics of bifurcations and phase transitions.
* The LPPL model considers the faster-than-exponential increase in asset prices decorated by accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. It embodies a positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations.
* The LPPL model was successfully used to predict time windows for the crashes of the Shanghai stock exchange composite index (SSEC) and the Shenzhen stock exchange component index (SZSC) in two distinct time periods: from mid-2005, bursting in October 2007, and from November 2008, bursting in the beginning of August 2009. The model was also successfully used to predict the peak in mid-2006 of the US housing bubble and the peak in July 2008 of the global oil bubble.
* The paper presents a detailed analysis of the individual Chinese index predictions and of the methods used to make and test them. The detection of log-periodic behavior was complemented with Lomb spectral analysis of detrended residuals and (H, q)-derivative of logarithmic indexes for both bubbles. Unit-root tests were performed on the residuals from the LPPL model to confirm the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck property of bounded residuals, in agreement with the consistent model of ‘explosive’ financial bubbles.
* The paper contributes to the literature on financial bubbles by presenting two case studies and new empirical tests, supporting the proposal that (i) the presence of a bubble can be diagnosed quantitatively before its demise and (ii) the end of the bubble has a degree of predictability.
* Bubbles are identified as “super-exponential” price processes, punctuated by bursts of negative feedback spirals of crash expectations. These works have been translated into an operational methodology to calibrate price time series and diagnose bubbles as they develop.
* The main method for detecting bubbles and predicting the critical time is fitting price time series to a log periodic power law (LPPL) model.
* This is complemented with other techniques to aid in filtering predictions and ensure a candidate prediction passes all tests to be considered worthy.
* A similar toolset has been developed by BNP Paribas Fortis Research Group on the same methodology.
* LPPL model used is ln[p(t)] = A + Bxm + Cxm cos(ω ln x + ), where x = tc − t measures the time to the critical time tc.
* LPPL condition is used to filter all fitting results: tc > t2, B < 0, 0 < m < 1, selecting regimes with faster-than-exponential acceleration of the log-price with a diverging slope at the critical future time tc.
* The implementation of fitting proceeds in two steps: Taboo search and Levenberg–Marquardt non-linear least squares algorithm.
* Stability of fits vs. shrinking and expanding intervals is tested, and probabilistic forecasts obtained reflect the intrinsic noisy nature of the underlying generating processes.
* Lomb spectral analysis is used to test the feature of log-periodicity in the LPPL model.
* Two bubbles were observed in both indexes during the period of investigation.
* The LPPL model describes well the behavior of faster-than-exponential increase corrected by logarithmic oscillations in both market indexes.
* Evidence for the presence of log-periodicity was provided by applying Lomb spectral analysis on the detrended residuals and (H, q)-derivative of market indexes.
* Unit-root tests confirm the O-U property and, thus, stationarity in the residuals, which is in good agreement with the consistent model of ‘explosive’ financial bubbles.
* Both bubbles were predicted in advance of their demise, which is in line with the consistent success of previous predictions by the same team.
* The study highlights the difference between predicting the end of a bubble and predicting the continuation of an “antibubble” bearish regime, which was a source of confusion in the literature.
* It is still an open problem to determine when an antibubble ends, and a delay of about six months before identifying the end of an antibubble was found.
* The antibubble method has had some past successes in predicting the end of bearish regimes following a market peak, but more tests in real time should be performed.

## Endogenous versus exogenous shocks in systems with memory
D. Sornettea; b;, A. Helmstetter, 2003
### Key findings
* Systems with long-range persistence and memory exhibit different precursory and recovery patterns in response to shocks of exogenous versus endogenous origins.
* Endogenous shocks result from a constructive interference of accumulated fluctuations, while exogenous shocks have an external origin.
* Recovery after an endogenous shock is slower at early times and can be slower or faster than after an exogenous perturbation at long times.
* Long-term behavior of complex systems is often controlled by rare catastrophic events, and the outstanding scientific question is how such large-scale patterns might evolve from a series of interactions on the smallest and increasingly larger scales or whether their origin should be searched from exogenous sources.
* Long memory processes may lead to specific signatures in the precursory and relaxation/recovery/adaptation of a system after a large fluctuation of its activity or after a catastrophic event that may allow one to distinguish an internal origin from an exogenous source.
* The study highlights the possibility of distinguishing between an endogenous versus exogenous cause of a given shock, even when there is no "smoking gun."
* This concept can be applied concretely to differentiate the effects on financial markets of exogenous versus endogenous shocks.


## Exogenous and endogenous market crashes as phase transitions in complex financial systems
J.M. Fry, 2012
### Key findings
* The paper presents a unifying framework for a set of seemingly disparate models for exogenous and endogenous shocks in complex financial systems.
* Financial markets operate by balancing intrinsic levels of risk and return, even during transitory shocks.
* Changes in market regime (bearish to bullish and bullish to bearish) represent a phase transition from random to deterministic behavior in prices.
* The resulting models refine the empirical analysis in a number of previous papers.
* The paper provides a novel framework unifying the various models for crash precursors and after-shock patterns in financial and social systems.
* The models for endogenous and exogenous market crashes have several applications to risk management and further research avenues.
* Empirical applications of the models show that the terror attacks of 9/11 represent an exogenous shock, while the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers is an exogenous event.
* The models suggest a more systematic treatment of market psychology and related themes.
* The paper sits alongside wider work on financial aspects of societal resilience and has implications for economic policy.


## Popping the Bitcoin Bubble: An application of log-periodic power law modeling to digital currency
Alec MacDonell, 2014
### Key findings
* Digital currencies such as Bitcoin have gained public interest and notoriety for their use in online black markets, but have yet to gain widespread acceptance.
* Digital currencies experience high volatility and uncertainty regarding value.
* Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions explain that Bitcoin values react to the CBOE Volatility Index, suggesting that a primary force driving Bitcoin values is speculation by investors looking outside traditional markets.
* Log-periodic power law (LPPL) models accurately predict ex-ante the crash that occurred in December 2013, making LPPL models a potentially valuable tool for understanding bubble behavior in digital currencies.
* Cryptocurrencies exist online, not in real space, and there is no authority guaranteeing their value, making them difficult to define as either commodity or fiat money.
* Bitcoin is the oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency, with values that have risen over $1000 per coin, making the movements in the data significant.
* The value of Bitcoin is primarily driven by the level of public interest over time and the level of investor confidence in traditional markets.
* Bitcoin values rise as the VIX falls, implying that when volatility in traditional markets is low, investors seek out Bitcoin precisely because its high volatility provides opportunities for speculation.
* Bitcoin values are driven almost entirely by investors, not consumers, as variables representing Bitcoin as a real medium of exchange did not come into the final model.
* LPPL models can be applied to historical financial bubbles to predict the timing of crash events and were able to predict the crash that occurred in December 2014, opening up the possibility of using LPPL models to understand future behavior in Bitcoin and other digital currencies.

## Are Bitcoin bubbles predictable? Combininga generalized Metcalfe’s Lawand the Log-Periodic PowerLaw Singularity model
Spencer Wheatley1, Didier Sornette, Tobias Huber1,Max Reppen and Robert N. Gantner, 2019
### Key findings
* The study developed a strong diagnostic for bubbles and crashes in Bitcoin by analyzing the coincidence (and its absence) of fundamental and technical indicators.
* A generalized Metcalfe’s Law based on network properties was used to quantify a fundamental value, which was shown to be heavily exceeded on at least four occasions by bubbles that grow and burst.
* The study detected a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth in these bubbles and modeled this pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which provides an ex ante warning of market instabilities and quantifies a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the crash time consistent with the actual corrections.
* The LPPLS model captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding and imitation.
* The study identifies a substantial but not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of Bitcoin, suggesting many months of volatile sideways Bitcoin prices ahead as of March 2018.

## A stable and robust calibration scheme of the log-periodic power law model
### Key findings
* The Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model provides a flexible framework for detecting bubbles and predicting changes in regime from the study of the price time series of a financial asset.
* The JLS model defines a bubble as a transient 'faster-than-exponential' growth, resulting from positive feedbacks.
* The Log Periodic Power Law (LPPL) proposed by JLS provides a way to detect bubbles and predict changes of regime from the study of the price time series of a financial asset.
* The study presents a simple transformation of the formulation of the log-periodic power law formula of the JLS model of financial bubbles that reduces it to a function of only three nonlinear parameters.
* The transformation significantly decreases the complexity of the fitting procedure and improves its stability tremendously because the modified cost function is now characterized by good smooth properties with in general a single minimum in the case where the model is appropriate to the empirical data.
* The power of the method is illustrated on the Chinese bubble of 2008.
* The modification provides an intuitive representation of the result of calibration.
* Empirical tests on the Shanghai Composite index (SSE) from January 2007 to March 2008 illustrate the findings.
* The modification reduces dimensionality and complexity of the calibration problem.
* With the proposed methodology, metaheuristic searches are no longer necessary, and one can resort solely to rigorous controlled local search algorithms, leading to a dramatic increase in efficiency.
* The JLS model describes faster-than-exponential price growth at a bubble regime.
* The determination of a bubble is difficult because the definition of what is a bubble is prone to controversies.
* The study provides a way to diagnose the formation of bubbles as early as possible to take appropriate countermeasures.

## Modelling crypto currencies Financial Time–Series
Leopoldo Cataniaa, Stefano Grassib
### Key findings
* Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have gained attention from the media, academics, and finance industry, and their market capitalization has grown rapidly.
* The dynamic of cryptocurrencies' financial time-series is complex, displaying extreme observations, asymmetries, and several nonlinear characteristics that are difficult to model.
* The paper develops a new dynamic model that can account for long-memory and asymmetries in the volatility process, as well as for the presence of time-varying skewness and kurtosis.
* The empirical application, carried out on 606 cryptocurrencies, indicates that a robust filter for the volatility of cryptocurrencies is strongly required.
* The inclusion of time-varying skewness systematically improves volatility, density, and quantile predictions at different horizons.
* The results of the study will be important for asset allocation, risk management, and pricing of derivative securities in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies.



## Some stylized facts of the Bitcoin market
Aurelio F. Bariviera c,∗, María José Basgall a,b, Waldo Hasperué b, Marcelo Naiouf b, 2017
### Key findings
* Bitcoin is a new type of currency that is not backed by any nation state or tangible asset, and is instead created through private agreement and facilitated by the anonymity of the internet.
* Bitcoin is the most widespread cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of 15 billion as of December 2016, and represents 89% of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies.
* Bitcoin's properties as a currency are not well-established; it is barely accepted as a medium of exchange, is not used as a unit of account, and is not a suitable option for storing value due to its great swings in price.
* Bitcoin is therefore more suitable as an asset for speculative purposes.
* The aim of this study is to investigate some statistical properties of Bitcoin and compare it with standard currencies during the period 2011-2017.
* The study focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales and tests the presence of long memory in return time series.
* The Hurst exponent is computed using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence.
* The Hurst exponent changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times.
* Multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process.
* The study expands the empirical studies by analyzing the long memory of a new asset, compares the behavior of Bitcoin with some major currencies, and highlights the evolution in the underlying dynamics of this new market.
* Speculation has a long history and seems inherent to capitalism; common features include difficulty in valuation, human greed, and super-exponential growth in time series.
* Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are a libertarian response to central bank failure and can bypass national restrictions on international transfers at a cheaper cost.
* Bitcoin is decentralized, with a growing army of miners validating transactions by gathering blocks, adding them to the ledger, and forming a block chain. Validation costs are cheaper than in a centralized system.
* Bitcoin transactions are secure since they are recorded in several computer servers globally, and transactions are "pseudonymous, not anonymous."
* Bitcoin is not regulated and does not have savings accounts or interest rates, making it difficult to assess its fair value. The use of Bitcoin in daily life is marginal.
* The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is the cornerstone of financial economics, stating that a market is informationally efficient if it "fully reflects all available information."
* Long memory in financial time series contradicts the EMH, as it allows a riskless profitable trading strategy.



## Datestamping the Bitcoin and Ethereum bubbles
Shaen Corbeta, Brian Lucey, Larisa Yarovayac, 2018
### Key findings
* The paper examines the existence and dates of pricing bubbles in Bitcoin and Ethereum using the Phillips et al. methodology.
* The authors examine the fundamental drivers of the price, including blockchain position, hashrate, and liquidity.
* The authors conclude that there are periods of clear bubble behavior, with Bitcoin now almost certainly in a bubble phase.
* The European Central Bank found in 2012 that cryptocurrencies do not jeopardize financial stability, but the market for cryptocurrencies has evolved significantly since then.
* The three measures (mining difficulty, hashrate, and liquidity) were selected to best represent the key theoretical components of cryptocurrency pricing structures.
* The authors find no clear evidence of a persistent bubble in the market for both Bitcoin or Ethereum, but there are distinct short-term time periods in which each fundamental influences the price dynamics of both cryptocurrencies.
* The authors find evidence supporting the view that Bitcoin is currently in a bubble phase and has been since the price increased above $1000.


## Bitcoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency
by REUBEN GRINBERG, 2011
### Key findings
* Bitcoin is a digital, decentralized, and partially anonymous currency, not backed by any government or other legal entity, and not redeemable for gold or any other commodity.
* Bitcoin relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity, making it highly liquid, with low transaction costs and the ability to make micropayments.
* Bitcoin's potential to facilitate anonymous transactions could allow organizations like Wikileaks to receive donations and conduct business without risking monetary seizure or sanctions.
* As of October 2011, one bitcoin is worth about two US dollars, and over 20 million bitcoin wallets exist.
* The Bitcoin economy is flourishing, but users are anxious about its legal status and the possibility of a government crackdown.
* Critics point to Bitcoin's potential for facilitating money laundering, tax evasion, and trade in illegal drugs and child pornography.
* Bitcoin operates in a legal grey area, and its status as a "security" within the meaning of federal securities laws is uncertain.
* Other legal issues that could affect Bitcoin include tax evasion, banking without a charter, state escheat statutes, and money laundering.



## New Private Monies, A Bit-Part Player?
Khaled Guesmia, Samir Saadia,b, Ilyes Abidd, Zied Ftitie, 2019
### Key findings
* Private money is a widely accepted medium of exchange or payment issued by a non-governmental body in the absence of any legal privileges.
* Private monies do not have to be generally acceptable; they merely have to be widely accepted.
* There is a public demand for and interest in private currencies from various groups of people.
* Examples of contemporary private monetary systems include the Liberty Dollar, e-gold and cryptocurrencies.
* The Liberty Dollar was based on a private mint that issued gold and silver coins and notes redeemable in precious metals.
* The Liberty Dollar was highly successful and became the second most popular currency in the US. However, the US government turned against it, declared its use a federal crime, and secured a conviction against its founder for counterfeiting, fraud, and conspiracy against the United States.
* e-gold was a private digital gold currency and an offshore payment system rather than a money transmitter or bank.
* The demand for Bitcoin has taken off since its launch in 2009 and it is increasingly used for both legal and illegal transactions.
* Though the supply of Bitcoin is limited, the demand is very variable, making its price very uncertain and creating a bubble-bust cycle in the Bitcoin market.
* The appropriate government response to private money is to allow competition on a level playing field between alternative forms of money.
* The US government is hostile towards private money, as illustrated by the Liberty Dollar and e-gold cases.
* Both the Liberty Dollar and e-gold were successful in providing gold-based private money but were attacked by the government, and their founders were convicted of criminal activities.
* Bitcoin is an unbreakable cryptocurrency issued by an anonymous user network, making it difficult for the government to locate.
* Private monetary systems must perform the basic functions of money at least as well as state money and demonstrate substantial benefits to achieve a significant market share.
* Private monies are expected to provide a measure of value or unit of account, which new private monies do achieve.
* Money should be effective as a medium of exchange and sufficiently widely acceptable, and Bitcoin has become acceptable for transactions in growing but mostly niche markets.
* Money should be a reasonable store of value, and those new private monies that are based on gold can be expected to be a better long-term store of value than state money.
* Modern private monies can also be used as a standard for deferred payments.
* The demand for private money is very much alive and well, and private monetary systems have been successful so far because the money they provide is superior to that provided by the state, at least for certain purposes.
* These private monetary systems point to the continuing allure of gold and the attraction of gold given the record of fiat money since the last link to gold was cut in 1971.
* Any particular money does not have to have a monopoly (whether private or state) to achieve success in the marketplace: there is no ‘need’ for any monopoly in money.
* The issues raised by contemporary private monetary systems are far-reaching, and there are ensuing issues that are raised by a newly emerging anarchic social order.

## The Economics of Cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin and Beyond
Jonathan Chiu, Thorsten V. Koeppl, 2017
### Key findings
* Cryptocurrencies can support payments without designating a third-party to control the currency.
* The welfare cost of a cryptocurrency can be comparable to a cash system with moderate inflation.
* A cryptocurrency can perform nearly as well as a low-value, retail payment system operating with very low fees.
* Most existing models of cryptocurrencies are built by computer scientists who mainly focus on the feasibility and security of these systems, while economic considerations are often ignored.
* Cryptocurrencies face a trade-off between how fast transactions settle and a guarantee for their settlement due to a double-spending problem.
* Bitcoin generates a welfare loss of 1.4% of consumption, but an optimal design can lower this to 0.08% by relying exclusively on money growth rather than transaction fees to finance mining rewards.
* Cryptocurrency systems can potentially be a valid alternative to retail payment systems that operate at very low fees, as soon as limits on the scale of such systems can be resolved.


## Are Cryptocurrencies the Future of Money?
MADELEINE GARTZ, IDA LINDERBRANDT, 2017
### Key findings
* Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, have gained interest and acceptance in Sweden due to the growing interest in digital assets and payment methods.
* A transition to cryptocurrency has both advantages and disadvantages, including time and cost-efficient payments, decentralized participation, and increased payer integrity. However, the large energy consumption and security concerns are significant obstacles for Bitcoin's further growth.
* Cryptocurrencies do not fulfill the functions of traditional currency, and a complete transition to cryptocurrency seems unfavorable for Sweden at present. Cryptocurrencies will coexist with traditional currencies and payment systems, and a transition may occur in the future when the market has matured and solutions to problems have been presented.
* Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be implemented, and as of April 29th, 2017, there exist over 800 cryptocurrencies with a total market capitalization of approximately 309BSEK. Today, Bitcoin dominates 61.4% of the cryptocurrency market, followed by Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.
* The technical prerequisites needed to maintain and use a Bitcoin payment system in Sweden are fulfilled by the majority of the population. However, a small minority does not meet the technical prerequisites due to a lack of equipment.
* Cryptocurrencies rely on mathematics and encryption, in difference to traditional fiat currencies, which rely on central banks. Trust and adoption are what gives a currency its value, together with the user's anticipation of being able to use the currency in the future.

## A new look at Cryptocurrencies
### Key findings
* Cryptocurrencies display diverse stylized facts, including long memory and heteroskedasticity.
* A single model can be used to conditionally measure the varied nature of cryptocurrencies, which helps evaluate their investability.
* Cryptocurrencies in general have unique properties, including leverage effects and Student-t error distributions.
* Academic interest in anonymous communications research dates back to the early 1980s.
* Nakamoto resurrected philosophies of Chaum with the addition of crowd sourcing and peer-to-peer networking to create the first digital currency, which offered anonymity through cryptographic protocols.
* The Cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy and is inefficient, with evidence of price clustering.
* Cryptocurrencies are drawing media and academic attention.
* Empirical data analysis shows that cryptocurrencies exhibit long memory, leverage, stochastic volatility, and heavy tailedness.
* The study expands its analysis to cover 224 cryptocurrency indices to contribute to a deeper understanding of cryptocurrencies.
* The study provides insights for regulators, investors, and governments to explore the topic further.

## Bitcoin: Medium of exchange or speculative assets?
Dirk G. Baur a,⇑, KiHoon Hong b, Adrian D. Lee, 2018
### Key findings
* Bitcoin is a hybrid between fiat currency and commodity currency without intrinsic value and independent of any government or monetary authority.
* Bitcoin is mainly used as a speculative investment and not as an alternative currency and medium of exchange.
* Potential users of virtual currencies as a medium of exchange may be attracted by its low transaction costs, peer-to-peer, global and government-free design and the possibility to purchase special goods for which the seller may prefer virtual currency.
* The success of the virtual currency as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value will depend on the balance between potential users and investors.
* Bitcoin returns are essentially uncorrelated with all major asset classes in normal and extreme times which offers large diversification benefits and low risk from a macro perspective.
* Bitcoin is designed as a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system and thus a medium of exchange. It can be defined as synthetic commodity money sharing features with both commodity monies such as gold and fiat monies such as the US dollar.
* Bitcoin is a hybrid of commodity money and fiat money.

## Bitcoin, gold and the dollar – A GARCH volatility analysis
Anne Haubo Dyhrberg, 2016
### Key findings
* The paper explores the financial asset capabilities of Bitcoin using GARCH models.
* Bitcoin has grown significantly since 2008 and its development poses great challenges and opportunities to policy makers, economists, and entrepreneurs.
* The analysis aims to classify Bitcoin as a financial asset to understand its role in the market, risk management, and portfolio analysis.
* Bitcoin is mostly treated as a speculative asset rather than a means of payment by its users.
* Bitcoin has similarities to gold and the dollar in terms of medium of exchange characteristics and hedging capabilities.
* Bitcoin is different from gold as it has limited liquidity possibilities and is not primarily used for store of value abilities.
* Bitcoin is different from the dollar as it is decentralized and largely unregulated, and it is not backed by a government.
* The GARCH framework is used to analyze Bitcoin's return behavior compared to gold and the dollar-euro exchange rate.
* Bitcoin reacts significantly to the federal funds rate which points to Bitcoin acting like a currency.
* Bitcoin is somewhere in between a currency and a commodity due to its decentralized nature and limited market size.

## Can volume predict Bitcoin returns and volatility? A quantiles-based approach
Mehmet Balcilara,b,c, Elie Bourid,⁎, Rangan Guptac, David Roubaudb, 2017
### Key findings
* Prior studies on the Bitcoin market have considered the role of Bitcoin transactions at the conditional mean of the returns distribution, while this study employs a non-parametric causality-in-quantiles test to analyze the causal relation between trading volume and Bitcoin returns and volatility over the whole of their respective conditional distributions.
* The causality-in-quantiles test reveals that volume can predict returns in the Bitcoin market except in Bitcoin bear and bull market regimes, highlighting the importance of modeling nonlinearity and accounting for the tail behavior when analyzing causal relationships between Bitcoin returns and trading volume.
* The study shows that volume cannot help predict the volatility of Bitcoin returns at any point of the conditional distribution.
* Understanding the volume-return paradigm in the Bitcoin market is essential to shedding light on potential implications for trading strategies.
* The nonparametric causality-in-quantiles approach used in the study is robust to misspecification errors as it detects the underlying dependence structure across the variables under study, allows for the detection of causality in the tails of the joint distribution of the variables, and allows for the study of higher-order dependency.
* No study thus far has explored the relationship between trading volume and price movement in the Bitcoin market in depth.
* The Bitcoin market has been characterized by sharp upward and downward price movement associated with high transaction volumes, and trends suggest a strong relationship between the magnitudes of price movement and transaction volume.
* Bitcoin is an open source software-based online payment system that is fully decentralized and depends on a sophisticated protocol that uses only cryptography to control transactions, manage its supply, and prevent harmful actions that may endanger the system.
* All transactions are stored digitally and recorded in a shared ledger data technology known as blockchain.
* Bitcoin market capitalization exceeded 10 billion USD in June 2016, which represents more than 80% of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies on the market.
* Studies have been interested in the 'moneyness' of Bitcoin, and some argue that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value but behaves more like a speculative investment than a currency because its market capitalization is high compared to the economic transactions it facilitates.
* Other studies have examined the price formation in the Bitcoin market, and some find that the total number of unique Bitcoin transactions per day - a demand-side variable - has more impact on the Bitcoin price than the number of Bitcoins - a supply-side variable.
* The Bitcoin volume-return relationship at the tails may be different from that near the mean of the return distribution, and prior studies have overlooked the dependency between the second moment of Bitcoin returns and trading volume.


## Volatility estimation for Bitcoin: A comparison of GARCH models
### Key findings
* Bitcoin has posed challenges and opportunities for policy makers, economists, entrepreneurs, and consumers.
* Bitcoin market is highly speculative, volatile, and susceptible to speculative bubbles.
* Previous studies have employed various GARCH-type models to examine Bitcoin price volatility.
* Most previous studies have used a single conditional heteroskedasticity model.
* This study aims to investigate which conditional heteroskedasticity model can describe the Bitcoin price volatility better over the whole period since its introduction.
* The best model is found to be the AR-CGARCH model.
* Including both a short-run and a long-run component of the conditional variance is significant for optimal goodness-of-fit to Bitcoin price data.
* Examining Bitcoin volatility is crucial for its place in financial markets and portfolio management.

## Safe haven or risky hazard? Bitcoin during the Covid-19 bear market
Thomas Conlon, Richard McGee, 2020
### Key findings
* The Covid-19 bear market represents the first significant market losses since Bitcoin began trading actively, providing a timely test of Bitcoin's safe haven properties.
* Empirical findings suggest that Bitcoin does not act as a safe haven during the crisis, decreasing in price in lockstep with the S&P 500.
* Holding even a small allocation of Bitcoin alongside the S&P 500 increases portfolio downside risk, contrary to expectations of diversification benefits.
* Loss aversion among investors may prompt them to seek out safe haven investments during market turbulence, but our results cast doubt on Bitcoin's ability to provide shelter from traditional market turmoil.
* While Bitcoin has been proposed as a safe haven for its independence from monetary policy, store of value, and limited correlation with traditional assets, previous studies have not comprehensively supported its hedging and safe haven properties.
* The speculative nature of Bitcoin may result in selling pressure during extreme downward markets, limiting its effectiveness as a store of value.
* Using measures of downside risk, our analysis indicates that adding Bitcoin to a portfolio results in increased portfolio risk during periods of market turmoil, instead of providing respite.
* Investors should not rely on Bitcoin as an alternative asset that provides shelter from turbulence in traditional markets.

## Portfolio diversification with virtual currency: Evidence from bitcoin

### Key findings
* The paper investigates the interaction between Bitcoin and financial indicators to understand the diversification and hedging effectiveness across gold asset and stock market.
* Bitcoin has a market capitalization close to seventeen billion dollars, making it the most widely known cryptocurrency followed by Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.
* Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that allows for the proof and transfer of its ownership without the need for an intermediary. This infrastructure provides a more efficient infrastructure for the transfer of money, allowing for cheaper and faster payments.
* The lack of a regulatory framework became the central issue of the bulk of cryptocurrency literature focusing primarily on Bitcoin price mechanism and its ability to develop into an alternative monetary system.
* The sudden surge of volatility in the exchange rate of Bitcoin by the end of 2013 triggered another strand of studies examining the speculative feature of Bitcoin.
* The paper shows that all models confirm the significant returns and volatility spillovers between Bitcoin and financial indicators.
* The VARMA (1,1)-DCC-GJR-GARCH is the best-fit model for modeling the joint dynamics of a variety of financial assets.
* A short position in the Bitcoin market allows hedging the risk investment for all different financial assets.
* Hedging strategies involving gold, oil, equities, and Bitcoin reduce considerably the portfolio's risk as compared to the risk of the portfolio made up of gold, oil, and equities only.

## On the hedge and safe haven properties of Bitcoin: Is it really more than a diversifier?
Elie Bouria,∗, Peter Molnárb, Georges Azzic, David Roubaudd, Lars Ivar Hagfors, 2017
### Key findings
* Bitcoin is a poor hedge but can be used for diversification purposes.
* Bitcoin can serve as a strong safe haven only against weekly extreme down movements in Asian stocks.
* Bitcoin's hedging and safe haven properties vary between horizons.
* Bitcoin can act as an effective diversifier for most of the cases.
* The liquidity of Bitcoin is a concern, and its diversification ability may not be constant over time.
* The empirical results can be helpful for policymakers, investors, and Bitcoin users.

## Bitcoin Asset Or Currency Revealing Users Hidden Intentions
Glaser, Florian, et al.,
### Key findings
* Digital currencies propose a shift away from the established design of financial system infrastructures, gaining public attention in light of the recent economic crisis.
* Bitcoin is the digital currency that attracts the most attention and is independent from a central institution responsible for money creation.
* The high exchange rate volatility of Bitcoin provides indications that it is considered a speculative financial asset rather than an alternative transaction system.
* The study aims to give empirical insights on whether users’ interest regarding digital currencies is driven by its appeal as an asset or as a currency.
* The results suggest that uninformed users approaching digital currencies are primarily interested in an alternative investment vehicle.
* Users’ current focus and growth regarding Bitcoin is limited to trading on exchanges rather than utilizing it as an alternative payment system.
* New users do not seem to consider Bitcoin’s original purpose of being used as an alternative transaction system.
* The recent dissemination of Bitcoin is lead by a shift of the average users’ intention regarding the utilization of Bitcoin.
* Before Bitcoin, there were other digital currencies such as Linden Dollar and virtual gold in World of Warcraft.
* These currencies were community currencies in a closed environment and were designed for payment within these environments.
* Bitcoin is recognized by the IRS and FINCEN as a virtual currency but not as a legal tender.
* In the USA, Bitcoin and virtual currencies are treated as a commodity for tax purposes.
* The EBA and ECB refer to Bitcoin as a virtual currency.
* Research on Bitcoin can be divided into two streams: design/technology and risks.
* Reid and Harrigan show that users and addresses can be mapped passively, Karame et al. find that 40% of students can be profiled passively, and Clark and Essex use Bitcoin to securely timestamp a document.
* Brezo and Bringas analyze risks involved in cryptocurrencies, including speculation, misinformation, and lack of regulatory oversight.
* Currency exchanges are a vital component in the Bitcoin ecosystem and have a substantial default risk.
* Moore and Christin analyze the main factors contributing to exchange default, while Buchholz et al. show that the Bitcoin ecosystem is currently in a state of an asset bubble.
* Academic research neglects the user/business perspective on Bitcoin, which is important in connecting the technological infrastructure with established economies.


## The macroeconomics of central bank issued digital currencies
John Barrdear and Michael Kumhof, 2016
### Key findings
* Central bank digital currency (CBDC) issuance, equivalent to 30% of GDP and implemented via distributed ledgers, could boost GDP by almost 3% in the United States by reducing real interest rates, distortionary taxes, and monetary transaction costs.
* Countercyclical CBDC price or quantity rules could help stabilize the business cycle and serve as a second monetary policy instrument.
* CBDC issuance could improve financial stability, provided that CBDC is only issued or withdrawn against government debt.
* The emergence of private digital currencies like Bitcoin raises concerns among policymakers. However, the innovation of their payment systems is of some interest.
* The only other theoretical work on private digital currencies has focused on exploring the conditions under which multiple units of account could exist in stable currency competition.
* CBDC can be a useful policy tool for central banks to stabilize the business cycle by controlling the quantity or price of CBDC in a countercyclical fashion.
* A CBDC regime can lead to a permanent increase in GDP of up to 3% due to reductions in real interest rates, distortionary tax rates, and monetary transaction costs.
* CBDC can contribute to financial stability if the issuance mechanism ensures that CBDC is only issued or withdrawn against government debt.
* The study used a theoretical monetary-financial DSGE model calibrated to match the pre-crisis United States and modeled CBDC as an imperfect substitute for bank deposits in the provision of monetary transaction services.
* The baseline simulation considered an initial stock of CBDC equal to 30% of GDP issued against an equal amount of government debt, and maintained at that level subject to countercyclical variations over the business cycle.
* Private digital currencies offer an alternative unit of account that is governed by predetermined money supply rules, and a payment system that is claimed to be superior to existing banking systems. However, the monetary aspects of private digital currencies are commonly held to be undesirable from the perspective of policymakers.


## Speculative bubbles in Bitcoin markets? An empirical investigation into the fundamental value of Bitcoin
Eng-Tuck Cheah, John Fry, 2014
### Key findings
* Bitcoin exhibits speculative bubbles, like many other asset classes.
* The fundamental value of Bitcoin is zero.
* Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency with an estimated market capitalization of $3.3 billion, but there are other alternative digital currencies known as altcoins.
* Competition between altcoins may drive down Bitcoin's market share.
* Bitcoin currently accounts for around 83% of the total estimated cryptocurrency capitalization of $3.9 billion.
* Bitcoin's vast proliferation and lack of regulation may mean its usage encourages black market activities to flourish and raises cybersecurity issues with both individuals and organizations coming under attack.
* The academic literature on digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, has only recently begun to emerge.
* Bitcoin prices appear to contain "a substantial speculative component" that warrants further investigation.
* The speculative component could potentially signify bubbles.
* Bitcoin's fluctuations in prices are not suggestive of a constant fundamental value, potentially undermining the role Bitcoin plays as a unit of account.
* Results from the study show that cryptocurrency markets share some stylized empirical facts with other markets, namely a vulnerability to speculative bubbles.

## BitCoin meets Google Trends and Wikipedia: Quantifying the relationship between phenomena of the Internet era
Ladislav Kristoufek, 2013
### Key findings
* Digital currencies have emerged as a fascinating phenomenon in financial markets.
* BitCoin is the most popular digital currency, and recent events on its exchange rates have risen crucial questions about its behavior.
* BitCoin offers a field to study the dynamics of the market which consists practically only of speculative traders with no fundamentalists as there is no fundamental value to the currency.
* The paper connects two phenomena of the latest years - digital currencies, namely BitCoin, and search queries on Google Trends and Wikipedia - and studies their relationship.
* The paper shows that the search queries and the prices are connected, and there also exists a pronounced asymmetry between the effect of an increased interest in the currency while being above or below its trend value.


## Statistical inference in vector autoregressions with possibly integrated processes
Andrew Phillip, Jennifer S.K. Chan, Shelton Peiris, 2018
### Key findings
* The conventional asymptotic theory is not applicable to hypothesis testing in levels VAR's if the variables are integrated or cointegrated.
* It is not known a priori whether the variables are integrated, cointegrated, or (trend) stationary. Hence, pretests for a unit root(s) and cointegration are usually required before estimating the VAR model.
* Tests for a unit root(s) in a single time series are available, but their power is known to be very low against the alternative hypothesis of (trend) stationarity.
* Tests for cointegration and cointegrating ranks have also been developed, but the tests for cointegrating ranks in Johansen-type ECM's are very sensitive to the values of the nuisance parameters in finite samples and hence not very reliable for sample sizes that are typical for economic time series.
* It is desirable to have a testing procedure that is robust to the integration and cointegration properties of the process so as to avoid possible pretest biases.
* The paper proposes a simple way to overcome the problems in hypothesis testing when VAR processes may have some unit roots.
* The proposed method is applicable whether the VAR's may be stationary (around a deterministic trend), integrated of an arbitrary order, or cointegrated of an arbitrary order.
* The method enables testing of linear or nonlinear restrictions on the coefficients by estimating a levels VAR and applying the Wald test, which is robust to the integration and cointegration properties of the process.


## Heterogeneous beliefs and routes to chaos in a simple asset pricing model
Paraskevi Katsiampa, 2017
### Key findings
* The paper investigates a simple present discounted value asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs.
* Agents choose from a finite set of predictors of future prices of a risky asset and revise their ‘beliefs’ in each period according to a ‘fitness measure’.
* Price fluctuations are thus driven by an evolutionary dynamics between different expectation schemes (‘rational animal spirits’).
* Using a mixture of local bifurcation theory and numerical methods, the paper investigates possible bifurcation routes to complicated asset price dynamics.
* The paper presents numerical evidence of strange, chaotic attractors when the intensity of choice to switch prediction strategies is high.
* Recent structural asset pricing models emphasize the role of heterogeneous beliefs in financial markets, with different groups of traders having different expectations about future prices.
* In most of these heterogeneous agent models, two typical investor types arise: rational ‘smart money’ traders or fundamentalists, and ‘noise traders’, sometimes called chartists or technical analysts.
* Empirical work has shown that simple technical trading strategies applied to the Dow Jones index may outperform several popular EMH stochastic finance models.
* Heterogenity in beliefs may lead to market instability and complicated dynamics, such as cycles or even chaotic fluctuations, in financial markets.
* The paper investigates a simple, demand—supply cobweb type adaptive belief system, with rational versus naive expectations and shows how heterogeneous beliefs may lead to market instability and strange attractors, when rational expectations are more costly to obtain than naive expectations.
* Bifurcations of the monetary steady state can arise, as the intensity of choice to switch prediction strategies increases.
