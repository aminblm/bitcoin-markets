1973, Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes:
The Black-Scholes model could be adapted to the bitcoin market by estimating the implied volatility of bitcoin options and using that to predict future bitcoin prices. However, it is worth noting that the assumptions underlying the Black-Scholes model may not hold in the highly volatile and rapidly changing bitcoin market.

1976, Jump-diffusion models, Robert Merton:
Jump-diffusion models can be adapted to the bitcoin market by modeling the jumps in bitcoin prices that are caused by sudden changes in demand or other factors. By estimating the parameters of the model from historical data, it may be possible to predict future jumps in bitcoin prices and adjust investment strategies accordingly.

1980, Hansen and Sargent's Uncertainty Models, Lars Hansen and Thomas Sargent:
Hansen and Sargent's uncertainty models could be used to estimate the level of uncertainty in the bitcoin market, which could be a predictor of future price movements. By modeling the relationship between uncertainty and bitcoin prices, it may be possible to make predictions about future bitcoin prices.

1980s-1990s, ARCH and GARCH Models, Robert Engle:
ARCH and GARCH models can be applied to the bitcoin market to estimate the volatility of bitcoin prices and to make predictions about future price movements based on historical data. However, it is important to note that these models assume that volatility is constant over time, which may not hold in the rapidly changing and highly volatile bitcoin market.

1985, Co-integration Theory, Clive Granger:
Co-integration theory could be applied to the bitcoin market to estimate the long-term relationship between bitcoin prices and other variables, such as interest rates or inflation. By estimating the co-integrating relationship and using it to make predictions about future bitcoin prices, it may be possible to improve the accuracy of forecasts.

1985, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model, John Cox, Jonathan Ingersoll, and Stephen Ross:
The CIR model can be applied to Bitcoin by modeling its volatility as a function of its own past prices and the past prices of other related assets. The model can be tweaked by calibrating the parameters to fit historical Bitcoin price data and then using the model to make future price predictions.

1985, New Keynesian Economics, N. Gregory Mankiw:
New Keynesian Economics can be applied to Bitcoin by analyzing the supply and demand factors that drive Bitcoin prices. The model can be tweaked by examining the factors that affect Bitcoin's supply (e.g., mining difficulty, halving events) and demand (e.g., adoption rates, regulatory changes) and then using those factors to make predictions about future Bitcoin prices.

1988, Shiller's CAPE Ratio (Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings Ratio), Robert Shiller:
Shiller's CAPE Ratio can be applied to Bitcoin by calculating its price-to-earnings ratio using its network hash rate as a proxy for its earnings. The model can be tweaked by comparing Bitcoin's CAPE Ratio to its historical average and to the CAPE Ratios of other assets to make predictions about future Bitcoin prices.

1992, Fama-French Three-Factor Model, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French:
The Fama-French Three-Factor Model can be applied to Bitcoin by modeling its excess returns as a function of market risk, size, and value factors. The model can be tweaked by using Bitcoin's market capitalization as a proxy for its size and comparing its price-to-book ratio to other assets as a proxy for its value factor.

1993, Heston Model, Steven Heston:
The Heston model can be applied to Bitcoin by modeling its volatility as a function of its own past prices and the past prices of other related assets, such as gold or the S&P 500. The model can be tweaked by calibrating the parameters to fit historical Bitcoin price data and then using the model to make future price predictions.

1993, VAR Model, Christopher Sims and Lawrence Klein:
The VAR model can be applied to Bitcoin by modeling its price as a function of its own past prices and the past prices of other related assets. The model can be tweaked by using a vector autoregression to model the relationship between Bitcoin and other assets and then using the model to make future price predictions.

- 4/10, 1960s-1970s, Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), Eugene Fama, The EMH suggests that market prices always incorporate all available information, which means that it may be difficult to predict future prices. However, the EMH has been shown to be too simplistic, and there may still be some predictability in markets.

- 5/10, 1960s, Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), William Sharpe, John Lintner, and Jan Mossin, While the CAPM has limitations, it provides a useful framework for understanding the relationship between risk and expected return, which can be applied to bitcoin investments.

- 2/10, 1961, Miller and Modigliani's Dividend Irrelevance Theory, Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani, Not directly applicable for predicting bitcoin prices as it deals with dividend policies of companies.

- 3/10, 1970, Akerlof's Market for Lemons model, George Akerlof, The model may not be directly applicable for predicting bitcoin prices, as it deals with asymmetric information in markets, but it highlights the importance of information in market transactions.

- 4/10, 1970, Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), Eugene Fama, See above.

- 3/10, 1972, Rational Expectations Hypothesis, Robert Lucas Jr., While the model highlights the role of expectations in decision-making, it may not be directly applicable for predicting bitcoin prices.

- 6/10, 1973, Black-Scholes Model, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, The Black-Scholes model provides a useful framework for pricing options, which can be applied to bitcoin options. However, the model has limitations and may not fully capture the complexity of market dynamics.

- 6/10, 1973, Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, See above.

- 6/10, 1973, Merton Model, Robert Merton, The Merton model is an extension of the Black-Scholes model that incorporates the possibility of default, which may be useful for predicting bitcoin prices in the context of credit risk.

- 6/10, 1974, Merton's Structural Credit Risk Model, Robert Merton, See above.

- 7/10, 1976, Jump-diffusion models, Robert Merton, Jump-diffusion models extend the Black-Scholes model to incorporate jumps in asset prices, which can be useful for predicting bitcoin prices in the context of high volatility.

- 5/10, 1977, Vasicek Model, Oldrich Vasicek, The Vasicek model provides a useful framework for modeling interest rate movements, which may indirectly affect bitcoin prices. However, the model has limitations and may not fully capture the complexity of interest rate dynamics.

- 4/10, 1980, Grossman and Stiglitz's Information Asymmetry model, Sanford Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz, The model may not be directly applicable for predicting bitcoin prices, but it highlights the importance of information in market transactions.


1973, Merton Model, Robert Merton:
The Merton model could be used to predict the probability of bitcoin defaulting on its debt obligations, which could provide insight into future bitcoin prices. However, this approach assumes that bitcoin has debt obligations, which may not be the case.

1974, Merton's Structural Credit Risk Model, Robert Merton:
The Merton model could be applied to the bitcoin market by estimating the credit risk of bitcoin and using that to predict future prices. This approach would require data on the creditworthiness of bitcoin, which may not be readily available.

1982, Real Business Cycle Theory, Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott:
Real Business Cycle Theory can be used to model the relationship between bitcoin prices and the broader economy, and to predict how changes in economic factors may affect future bitcoin prices. However, this approach assumes that bitcoin is closely tied to the broader economy, which may not be the case.

1952, Markowitz's Portfolio Theory, Harry Markowitz:
Markowitz's Portfolio Theory can be applied to the bitcoin market by creating an optimal portfolio of assets that includes bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. By estimating the expected return and risk of each asset and optimizing the portfolio composition, it may be possible to create a diversified portfolio that includes bitcoin and can generate higher returns than simply investing in bitcoin alone.

1986, Ho-Lee Model, Thomas Ho and Sang Bin Lee:
The Ho-Lee model can be applied to Bitcoin by modeling the term structure of interest rates and using it to predict future Bitcoin prices. The model can be tweaked by using Bitcoin futures or options prices to estimate the market's expectations of future Bitcoin prices and then using those expectations to model the term structure of interest rates.
