    "## The Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the LPPL model, the LPPLS model assumes that asset prices are driven by a complex system of market participants with heterogeneous beliefs, expectations, and trading strategies. In this framework, bubbles are characterized by a self-reinforcing feedback loop between bullish expectations and actual price increases, leading to an exponential rise in prices that eventually become unsustainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPLS model incorporates several key assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The market is efficient in the long run, but can be subject to temporary bubbles or crashes due to irrational behavior or exogenous shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The price of an asset is driven by a combination of fundamental factors, such as market capitalization, network activity, or social sentiment, and speculative factors, such as herd behavior or momentum trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bubbles are characterized by a log-periodic power law pattern, where the price increases with a non-linear power function of time, and the frequency of oscillation increases as the critical time of the bubble approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The LPPLS model can be used to predict the timing and magnitude of a bubble's collapse, based on the estimated critical time, the LPPL exponent, and the amplitude of the oscillations, as well as the impact of generalized error and jump-diffusion processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPLS model uses a power-law function to describe the growth of the market, and a logarithmic function to describe the oscillations in the market. The model is characterized by several parameters, including the critical time, the critical amplitude, and the critical exponent, as well as the parameters that capture the impact of generalized error and jump-diffusion processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPLS model can be represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ln(P(t))=A+B(t_c-t)^m+C(t_c-t)^m\\cos(\\omega\\ln(t_c-t)+\\phi)+D\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{-\\beta(t-t_i)}+ J(t) +\\sigma_t \\cdot z_t + \\epsilon_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPPLS (Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity) model is a mathematical equation used to analyze the behavior of financial markets, particularly during speculative bubbles. It is a non-linear model that aims to capture the dynamics of price movements in financial markets by modeling the log of the asset price, denoted as $\\ln(P(t))$, as a function of time, $t$. The LPPLS model can be broken down into several components, which are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logarithmic trend component**: $A$. This component represents the long-term trend in the price of the asset and is modeled using a constant term. It captures the overall upward or downward movement of the price, irrespective of the short-term fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Power-law component**: $B(t_c-t)^m$. This component represents the power-law growth rate of the asset price leading up to the bubble peak. $B$ is a scaling factor that determines the strength of the power-law growth rate, while $t_c$ represents the time of the expected crash or bubble peak, and $m$ is a parameter that determines the curvature of the power-law growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Log-periodic component**: $C(t_c-t)^m\\cos(\\omega\\ln(t_c-t)+\\phi)$. This component represents the periodic oscillations that occur within the bubble. The term $C$ is a scaling factor that determines the amplitude of the oscillations, while $\\omega$ and $\\phi$ are parameters that control the frequency and phase of the oscillations, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Correction factor component**: $D\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{-\\beta(t-t_i)}$. This component represents the correction factor that adjusts the power-law growth rate and log-periodic oscillations to account for the effects of news and other exogenous factors. $D$ is a scaling factor that determines the strength of the correction factor, while $\\beta$ represents the decay rate of the correction factor, and $t_i$ denotes the time of each exogenous event.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Jump term component**: $J_t$ This component captures sudden, large price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Volatility term component**: $\\sigma_t \\cdot z_t$. This component captures the estimated GARCH volatility of the asset at time $t$ and is modeled as the product of a random variable $z_t$ drawn from a standard normal distribution and the estimated volatility $\\sigma_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Error term component**: $\\epsilon_t$. This component represents the random fluctuations around the model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplification and for the next sections, let's call a new variable, $y(t)$ our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = \\ln(P(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also introduce several other indicators to our LPPLS model and attempt to predict them as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The critical time\n",
    "\n",
    "In the LPPLS (Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity) model, $t_c$ represents the expected time of the crash or the bubble peak. The definition of $t_c$ in the LPPLS model is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t_c = t_m - \\ln(\\frac{\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}}{\\omega})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t_m$ is the estimated time of the maximum of the log-periodic power law, and $\\omega$ is the frequency of oscillation of the log-periodic power law.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation provides an estimate of the time of the bubble peak or crash, which is a key parameter in the LPPLS model. The value of $t_c$ can be used to predict the timing of a potential market crash or bubble peak, and to estimate the probability of such an event occurring based on the parameters of the LPPLS model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We model the rest of the component with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid components $(H_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Market-to-Metcalfe ratio power law \n",
    "\n",
    "The Market-to-Metcalfe value (MMV) is a ratio used to evaluate the network value of a cryptocurrency relative to the value of its transactions. It is calculated by dividing the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency by the product of its daily transaction volume and the average transaction value. The MMV is named after Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet and co-founder of the technology news website, TechCrunch, who proposed the concept as a way to evaluate the network effects of cryptocurrencies. The MMV is often used as an indicator of the fundamental value of a cryptocurrency and can be used to compare the valuation of different cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Market-to-Metcalfe ratio can be considered as a fundamental indicator. This is because it compares the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency to its network value, which is a fundamental metric that reflects the underlying utility and adoption of the cryptocurrency. The Metcalfe's law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users, and the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio is derived from this law to provide a measure of the network's value relative to its market capitalization. Therefore, the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio can be used to assess whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued relative to its fundamental value.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio can also be influenced by speculative factors, such as hype and FOMO (fear of missing out), which can drive up the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency without a corresponding increase in its network value. In this sense, the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio can also capture some speculative elements in the cryptocurrency market. Overall, the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio can be seen as a hybrid indicator that incorporates both fundamental and speculative factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that the interpretation of the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio as either a fundamental or speculative indicator may depend on the context and time period of analysis. For instance, during periods of high market volatility and hype, the ratio may be more influenced by speculative factors, while during periods of stability and adoption, the ratio may be more reflective of fundamental factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest two ways to incorporate the MMV to our LPPLS model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Directly incorporating the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio into the equation\n",
    "Multiply the existing LPPLS equation by the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio, denoted as $M(t)$, to obtain: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{MMVa}(t) = \\ln(P(t) \\cdot \\alpha_0 M(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach involves directly incorporating the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio into the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Market-to-Metcalfe ratio as a separate variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio as an additional independent variable in the LPPLS equation. The equation becomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{MMVb}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_0 \\ln(M(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach treats the Market-to-Metcalfe ratio as a separate variable, which may allow for more nuanced analysis of its impact on the cryptocurrency price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamental components $(F_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This component captures the underlying value of Bitcoin based on its fundamentals, such as adoption rates, transaction volume, and hash rate. To simplify the model, we will assume that the fundamental component is a weighted average of these factors, with each factor given a weight based on its importance. Let $F_t$ denote the fundamental component at time $t$, and let $X_i$ denote the $i$-th fundamental factor. Then the formula for $F_t$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(t) = w_1X_1 + w_2X_2 + ... + w_nX_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_F = y(t) + F(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_i$ is the weight assigned to the $i$-th fundamental factor. The weights can be determined using regression analysis or other statistical methods, and should reflect the relative importance of each factor in determining Bitcoin's underlying value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of the fundamental components include the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hash rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash rate refers to the computational power of the Bitcoin network, which is used to mine new blocks and process transactions. A higher hash rate indicates a more secure network and a greater demand for mining, which can drive up the Bitcoin price. We can incorporate hash rate into the LPPLS model using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{HR}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_9 \\ln(\\text{HR}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_{HR}$ is the logarithmic trend component with hash rate, and $\\alpha$ is a coefficient that captures the impact of hash rate on the Bitcoin price.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transaction volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction volume measures the total number of Bitcoin transactions over a given period. An increase in transaction volume can signify a growing user adoption and network usage, which can lead to an increase in demand for Bitcoin and a higher price. We can include transaction volume into the LPPLS model using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{TV}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_{10} \\ln(\\text{TV}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_{TV}$ is the logarithmic trend component with transaction volume, and $\\alpha$ is a coefficient that captures the impact of transaction volume on the Bitcoin price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speculative components $(S_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This component captures the influence of market sentiment, momentum, and other speculative factors on Bitcoin's price. To simplify the model, we will assume that the speculative component is a weighted average of these factors, with each factor given a weight based on its importance. Let $S_t$ denote the speculative component at time $t$, and let $Y_i$ denote the $i$-th speculative factor. Then the formula for $S_t$ is:\n",
    "$$S(t) = v_1Y_1 + v_2Y_2 + ... + v_mY_m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_S = y(t) + S_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_i$ is the weight assigned to the $i$-th speculative factor. The weights can be determined using regression analysis or other statistical methods, and should reflect the relative importance of each factor in determining Bitcoin's price in the short term.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risk premium\n",
    "The risk premium is the difference between the expected return on an asset and the risk-free rate of return. This concept was first introduced by Nobel Prize laureate Eugene Fama. The LPPLS model with risk premium can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{RP}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_2 (\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(\\text{RP}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{RP}$ is the risk-free rate of return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why the indicators are added in the following way: $\\alpha(\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(\\text{risk-free rate}))$ is to adjust for the risk associated with investing in Bitcoin compared to a risk-free asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural logarithm of the asset price, $\\ln(P(t))$, is used to transform the price data into a log-scale, which makes it easier to analyze and model non-linear patterns. The logarithm of the risk-free rate, $\\ln(\\text{risk-free rate})$, is used as a benchmark to compare the returns of Bitcoin against a risk-free asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the two logarithms, $(\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(\\text{risk-free rate}))$, represents the excess return of Bitcoin compared to the risk-free asset. The excess return is then multiplied by a scaling factor, $\\alpha$, which represents the risk premium associated with investing in Bitcoin. The risk premium is a measure of the extra return that investors require for taking on the additional risk of investing in Bitcoin compared to a risk-free asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By including the risk premium in the model, we are accounting for the additional risk that investors are taking on when investing in Bitcoin. This can help to provide a more accurate prediction of future Bitcoin prices by taking into account the level of risk associated with investing in the asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option-implied volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "Option-implied volatility is a measure of the market's expectation of future volatility, derived from the prices of options on the asset. This indicator was developed by Robert Engle, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2003. The LPPLS model with option-implied volatility can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{OIV} = y(t) + \\alpha_1 \\ln(\\text{OIV}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a coefficient that captures the impact of option-implied volatility on the asset price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moving averages\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving averages are a popular technical indicator used to identify trends in financial markets. They were first introduced by Nobel Prize laureate Charles Dow. The LPPLS model with moving averages can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{MA}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_3 (\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(MA_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{MA}(t)$ is the moving average of the asset price up to time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Momentum indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum indicators are used to identify trends in financial markets by comparing current prices to historical prices. They were first introduced by Nobel Prize laureate Louis Bachelier. The LPPLS model with momentum indicators can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{MI}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_4 (\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(\\text{MI}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{momentum indicator}(t)$ is the momentum indicator of the asset price up to time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum is a measure of an asset's recent price trend, calculated by taking the difference between the current price and the price $n$ periods ago. This indicator was developed by Robert Shiller, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013. The LPPLS model with momentum can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{MOM}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_5 (\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(\\text{MOM}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $MOM$ is the momentum over the previous $n$ periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Relative Strength Index (RSI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The RSI is a technical indicator used to analyze the momentum of Bitcoin's price movements. It was developed by J. Welles Wilder, a mechanical engineer and technical analyst. The RSI ranges from 0 to 100 and is calculated by comparing the average gains and losses of Bitcoin's price over a specified period. The mathematical equation for RSI integration into the LPPLS model can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{RSI}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_6 \\ln(\\text{RSI}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incorporating NVT Ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "The NVT (Network Value to Transactions) ratio can be added to the LPPL model as an additional explanatory variable that captures the relationship between the network value of a cryptocurrency and its transaction volume. It was proposed by Willy Woo, a Bitcoin analyst. The NVT ratio is calculated as the Bitcoin market capitalization divided by the daily on-chain transaction volume. This can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{NVT}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_7 \\cdot \\ln(NVT_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $NVT_t$ is the NVT ratio of the asset at time $t$, and $\\gamma$ is the estimated coefficient of the NVT ratio variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine the overall sentiment of market participants towards Bitcoin. It was proposed by Shiller, an Nobel Prize laureate economist and Bo Pang and Lillian Lee, computer science researchers. Sentiment analysis can be performed using machine learning algorithms to analyze news articles, social media posts, and other sources of information. The mathematical equation for sentiment analysis integration into the LPPLS model can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{S}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_8 \\ln(\\text{S}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fear and Greed Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fear and Greed Index is a sentiment indicator that measures the emotions and sentiments of market participants towards Bitcoin. A high Fear and Greed Index score can indicate that the market is in a state of greed, and a low score can suggest a state of fear. We can incorporate Fear and Greed Index into the LPPLS model using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{FG}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_{11} \\ln(\\text{FG}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_{FG}$ is the logarithmic trend component with Fear and Greed Index, and $\\alpha$ is a coefficient that captures the impact of Fear and Greed Index on the Bitcoin price.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Trends is a tool that allows us to measure the relative search volume for Bitcoin on Google over time. A higher Google Trends score can indicate a growing interest and awareness of Bitcoin, which can translate into a higher demand for the cryptocurrency and a higher price. We can integrate Google Trends into the LPPLS model using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{GT}(t) = y(t) + \\alpha_{12} \\ln(\\text{GT}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_{GT}$ is the logarithmic trend component with Google Trends, and $\\alpha$ is a coefficient that captures the impact of Google Trends on the Bitcoin price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating additional variables into the LPPLS model equation can improve its accuracy and predictability. The market capitalization, NVT ratio, and social media sentiment are all important factors that can influence the Bitcoin price. By incorporating these variables into the LPPL model equation, we can develop a more comprehensive and accurate prediction model for Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further enhance the predictive power of the LPPL model, it is necessary to consider a broader range of predictors beyond those discussed in the paper. While incorporating market capitalization, NVT ratio, social media sentiment, and technical analysis indicators can be useful, there are other predictors that could be valuable in predicting Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such predictor is mining difficulty, which measures the computational power required to mine Bitcoin. Mining difficulty is adjusted periodically to ensure that new Bitcoin blocks are added to the blockchain at a steady rate. Increases in mining difficulty indicate that more computational power is required to mine Bitcoin, which can lead to higher transaction fees and longer processing times. This can, in turn, affect the demand for Bitcoin and potentially impact its price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another predictor to consider is the number of active Bitcoin addresses. The number of active addresses reflects the level of activity on the Bitcoin network and can provide insights into the adoption and usage of Bitcoin. Higher levels of activity could indicate increasing interest and adoption of Bitcoin, which may drive up its price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating these additional predictors into the LPPLS model equation can potentially improve its predictive power and provide more accurate forecasts of Bitcoin prices. However, it is important to note that the relationship between these predictors and Bitcoin prices is complex and multifaceted. Therefore, careful analysis and modeling are necessary to fully understand their impact on Bitcoin prices."
