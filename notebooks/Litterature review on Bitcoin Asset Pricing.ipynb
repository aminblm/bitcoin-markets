    "disappearance of 39–47% of fossilizable genera and perhaps 75% of species) marking\n",
    "the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary about 65 millions ago is often attributed to the\n",
    "impact of a huge meteor inthe Yucatanpeninsula [ 4]. Another scenario is that a burst\n",
    "of active volcanism was the real origin of the extinction [5,6]. It has beensuggested\n",
    "that this extinction was actually driven by longer-term climatic changes, as evidence\n",
    "by the fact that certainspecies inthe Late Maastrichtiandisappeared a distinctive time\n",
    "before the K/T boundary [7,8]. A completely endogenous origin has also been proposed,\n",
    "based on the concepts of nonlinear feedbacks between species [9,10] illustrated by\n",

    "\n",
    "* Systems with long-range persistence and memory exhibit different precursory and recovery patterns in response to shocks of exogenous versus endogenous origins.\n",
    "* Endogenous shocks result from a constructive interference of accumulated fluctuations, while exogenous shocks have an external origin.\n",
    "* Recovery after an endogenous shock is slower at early times and can be slower or faster than after an exogenous perturbation at long times.\n",
    "* Long-term behavior of complex systems is often controlled by rare catastrophic events, and the outstanding scientific question is how such large-scale patterns might evolve from a series of interactions on the smallest and increasingly larger scales or whether their origin should be searched from exogenous sources.\n",
    "* Long memory processes may lead to specific signatures in the precursory and relaxation/recovery/adaptation of a system after a large fluctuation of its activity or after a catastrophic event that may allow one to distinguish an internal origin from an exogenous source.\n",
    "* The study highlights the possibility of distinguishing between an endogenous versus exogenous cause of a given shock, even when there is no \"smoking gun.\"\n",
    "* This concept can be applied concretely to differentiate the effects on financial markets of exogenous versus endogenous shocks.\n",

    "In this paper we draw upon the close relationship between statistical physics and mathematical finance to develop a suite of models for financial bubbles and crashes. The derived models allow for a probabilistic and statistical\n",

    "Econophysics is an interdisciplinary subject that applies tools and\n",

    "For an introduction to econophysics and a comparison between finance\n",
    "and physics see Sornette (2014). As the econophysics movement has\n",
    "gained momentum our paper thus contributes to wider debates such\n",
    "as probabilistic and statistical approaches to econophysics (Bree &\n",

    "work in econophysics holds (Fry, 2015; Sornette, 2003).\n",
    "Econophysics has been used to tackle a wide range of practical problems in finance and economics. This includes applications to options\n",
    "pricing and risk management (Bouchaud & Potters, 2003), the statistical\n",
    "characterisation of heavy-tailed asset returns distributions (Cont,\n",
    "2001), empirical power-laws (Gabaix, Gopikrishnan, Plerou, & Stanley,\n",
    "2003; Plerou, Stanley, & Gabaix, 2004), agent-based modelling (see\n",
    "e.g. Hommes, 2006; Le Baron, 2006), income-tax evasion (Pickhardt &\n",
    "Seibold, 2014), speculative bubbles (Johansen et al., 2000; Sornette,\n",
    "2003) and the impact of high-frequency trading upon the stability of\n",
    "global financial markets (Filimonov & Sornette, 2012). One practical\n",
    "problem that econophysics has recently begun to address is the issue\n",
    "of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid huge media and public interest Bitcoin and cryptocurrency\n",
    "markets present enormous legal (Grinberg, 2012; Plasaras, 2013), regulatory (Ali, Barrdear, Clews, & Southgate, 2014; European Central Bank,\n",
    "2012; Gandal & Hałaburda, 2014) and ethical (Angel & McCabe, 2015)\n",
    "challenges. Cryptocurrency markets have also been extremely volatile\n",
    "with the market share and market capitalisations of several\n",
    "cryptocurrencies fluctuating wildly (White, 2014). Though initially\n",
    "dominated by other disciplines the financial and economic literature\n",
    "on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has recently started to emerge (see\n",
    "e.g. Dowd, 2014; Dwyer, 2015; Weber, 2014a). Cryptocurrencies have\n",
    "also been the focus of several recent econophysics papers (see e.g.\n",
    "Cheah & Fry, 2015; Garcia, Tessone, Mavrodiev, & Perony, 2014;\n",
    "Kristoufek, 2013). Their dependence on self-fulfilling expectations and\n",
    "the lack of a centralised governance body mean that, without wishing\n",
    "to exaggerate the importance of econophysics, cryptocurrency markets\n",
    "may prove especially amenable to econophysics approaches.\n",
    "The objective of this paper is to showcase the use of tools and techniques from econophysics via a novel application to the two largest\n",
    "cryptocurrency markets. The importance of our contribution is fivefold.\n",
    "Firstly, we develop an econophysics model for bubbles and crashes that\n",
    "can be fitted to empirical financial data using standard statistical techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation. Whilst applicable to\n",
    "general financial markets our model may thus have specific relevance\n",
    "to cryptocurrency markets. Secondly, we contribute to a fledgling academic literature on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. Thirdly, we\n",
    "find empirical evidence of negative bubbles in cryptocurrency markets –\n",
    "complementing earlier documented evidence of speculative bubbles in\n",
    "the literature. Fourthly, we address the issue of competition between\n",
    "rival cryptocurrencies. This is significant as the issue of contagion and\n",
    "co-dependence is particularly pertinent for cryptocurrency markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "One notable example of this is that the market share of the two largest\n",
    "cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ripple has fluctuated quite dramatically in\n",
    "recent months. Here, we find evidence of a spillover from Ripple to\n",
    "Bitcoin. Fifthly, we develop a model to independently verify the impact\n",
    "of putative market shocks (identified by academics and practitioners\n",
    "alike) upon Bitcoin. Results suggest that cryptocurrency markets are inherently complex and are often misunderstood by academics and practitioners alike.\n",
    "The layout of this paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a brief overview\n",
    "of econophysics and reviews the academic literature on Bitcoin and\n",
    "cryptocurrencies. Section 3 develops the basic bubble/antibubble\n",
    "model and its extension to higher dimensions. Section 4 discusses a\n",
    "model for unpredictable market shocks. The model is later used to\n",
    "track the effect of events such as the closure of the illegal Silk Road\n",
    "website and the collapse of the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox\n",
    "upon Bitcoin prices. Empirical applications are discussed in Section 5.\n",
    "Section 6 concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Econophysics is perhaps best defined as the use of paradigms and\n",
    "tools from theoretical and statistical physics to model financial and economic systems (Mantegna & Stanley, 1999). The movement has a long\n",
    "history. For a historical overview see e.g. Jovanovic and Schinckus\n",
    "(2013) and Chen and Li (2012). The term econophysics was first coined\n",
    "in Stanley et al. (1996) and the modern arm of the movement can trace\n",
    "its origins to several key developments that occurred in the 1990s.\n",
    "These include technical developments in the mathematics of Lévy processes and the development of increased computer processing power\n",
    "together with the ready availability of large electronic financial databases. Allied to the above as time has progressed several economics\n",
    "and finance journals have also become more receptive to ideas from\n",
    "econophysics (Jovanovic & Schinckus, 2013).\n",
    "Speculation and financial crises have been endemic throughout\n",
    "human history (Reinhart & Rogoff, 2009). Bubbles typically occur\n",
    "when the price of an asset grows rapidly and does so in a manner far removed from realistic assessments of the asset's intrinsic value (Phillips\n",
    "& Yu, 2011). The implication is that such a dramatic price rise sets up\n",
    "asset prices for a subsequent fall. Kindelberger and Aliber (2005) describe bubbles as a sharp rise in asset prices – with the initial rise generating expectations of further rises and attracting new buyers via a\n",
    "process commonly labelled irrational exuberance (Shiller, 2005). However, beyond these definitions, and real economic suffering, both the\n",
    "theoretical existence of bubbles, and issues related to their empirical detection, remain hotly debated (Gurkaynak, 2008; Vogel & Werner,\n",
    "2015).\n",
    "From a statistical physics perspective stock market crashes represent\n",
    "a rupture event in a complex system (Feigenbaum, 2003). This analogy\n",
    "with exactly soluble models in statistical mechanics led to the development of phenomenological log-periodic power-law models for bubbles\n",
    "where the price exhibits unsustainably high super-exponential growth\n",
    "(Feigenbaum & Freund, 1996; Sornette, Johansen, & Bouchaud, 1996).\n",
    "A rational expectations version of the original model was then formulated in Johansen et al. (2000) thereby forming a potential bridge with the\n",
    "mainstream economics and finance literature. Despite some initial controversy (see e.g. Feigenbaum, 2001a, 2001b) econophysics modelling\n",
    "of financial bubbles has continued to grow from strength to strength –\n",
    "in part as a response to the increasingly volatile nature of global financial markets.\n",
    "Even before the 2008 crisis one dramatic unintended consequence of\n",
    "the increased computerisation of financial markets described above was\n",
    "increased speculation and volatility (Barber & Odean, 2001). This in turn\n",
    "has lent weight to the empirically oriented approach favoured by\n",
    "econophysics as financial markets evolved. Statistical physics, and its\n",
    "\n",
    "reincarnation into econophysics, is chiefly concerned with providing\n",
    "the best possible explanation of empirically observable phenomena.\n",
    "This contrasts sharply with the rigid theoretical frameworks often associated with both financial economics and mathematical finance\n",
    "(Jovanovic & Schinckus, 2013).The modelling of financial bubbles and\n",
    "crashes has thus emerged as a key part of the wider econophysics movement (Feigenbaum, 2003). This has gained added impetus since the\n",
    "2008 crisis with several econophysics papers modelling bubbles and\n",
    "crashes appearing in well-respected finance and economics journals in\n",
    "recent years (see e.g. Bree & Joseph, 2013; Geraskin & Fantazzini,\n",
    "2013; Kurz-Kim, 2012; Lin & Sornette, 2013; Lin et al., 2014).\n",
    "A range of empirical findings reported in the literature suggest that\n",
    "econophysics can indeed generate useful insights into real markets.\n",
    "For example, econophysics can be used to shed new light into the monetary roots of bubbles and crashes (Corsi & Sornette, 2014). In line with\n",
    "this practically-minded approach the functioning of Bitcoin and other\n",
    "cryptocurrency markets represents an interesting problem in its own\n",
    "right and one that also presents new challenges to mainstream economics and finance (see Section 2.2).\n",
    "2.2. The cryptocurrency market\n",
    "The use of cryptocurrencies has gained traction in response to the perceived failures of government and central banks during the 2008 crash\n",
    "(Weber, 2014a). Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may also offer\n",
    "cheaper alternatives to existing debit and credit card systems (Angel &\n",
    "McCabe, 2015), in part reflecting recent technological innovations in regular monetary systems (Böhme, Christin, Edelman, & Moore, 2015;\n",
    "European Central Bank, 2012). Amid huge media and public interest the\n",
    "academic literature on Bitcoin is only recently starting to emerge (see\n",
    "e.g. Frisby, 2014; Vigna & Casey, 2015). Initially the debate surrounding\n",
    "the use of cryptocurrencies appeared to be dominated both by Bitcoin\n",
    "and by other disciplines such as computer science (see e.g. Böhme,\n",
    "Brenner, Moore, & Smith, 2014; Sadeghi, 2013) and law (see e.g.\n",
    "Grinberg, 2012; Plasaras, 2013). However, as discussed in this subsection,\n",
    "a fledgling economics and finance literature is starting to emerge. In particular, previous literature on Bitcoin raises several interesting questions\n",
    "such as the exact nature of Bitcoin, the long-term sustainability of Bitcoin,\n",
    "competition in the market for digital currencies and an on-going ethical\n",
    "debate surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Our paper also contributes to these discussions and adds to a burgeoning econophysics literature on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "The cryptocurrency market warrants close scrutiny given its increasingly high profile. The sums of money involved are substantial. The\n",
    "total cryptocurrency market capitalisation is estimated to be $7.1 billion\n",
    "(www.coinmarketcap.com, January 2016). Amongst over 600 traded\n",
    "cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ripple are the two most popular\n",
    "cryptocurrencies with around 91% and 2.8% of the entire cryptocurrency\n",
    "market capitalization respectively though as recently as May 2015 the\n",
    "market share of Ripple was as high as 6%. Ripple and Bitcoin share important characteristics such as their ultimate dependence upon the trust of\n",
    "their users and a unique network currency (Bitcoin for Bitcoin and XRP\n",
    "in Ripple respectively). However, there are also important differences.\n",
    "Ripple is primarily designed to serve as a medium of exchange and as a\n",
    "distributed payment system as opposed to an alternative currency per\n",
    "se. Ripple is thus arguably more like a new improved form of PayPal or\n",
    "Mastercard than a “digital dollar”. This ready convertibility means the\n",
    "Ripple network itself actually accepts Bitcoin and, inter alia, allows\n",
    "users to trade precious metals like gold and silver, cryptocurrencies, conventional currencies like the US Dollar and the GB Pound and even assets\n",
    "like air miles with lower transaction costs using its own native digital currency – the XRP. This added flexibility makes Ripple a strong potential\n",
    "rival to Bitcoin. Despite its obvious relevance and importance research\n",
    "into Ripple appears to be almost non-existent due to its lack of widespread usage prior to 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it is a highly unconventional and fast-moving area it is important to note that there is a wealth of available statistical information\n",
    "about Bitcoin and other digital currencies that renders academic study\n",
    "of the area entirely possible. One key source of information (rather\n",

    "Econophysics thus has a crucial role to play as global cryptocurrency\n",

    "2014) recently developed econophysics models for negative bubbles\n",

    "### Key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "* The paper develops models for financial bubbles and crashes using tools and techniques from statistical physics and mathematical finance\n",
    "* The models allow for a probabilistic and statistical formulation of econophysics models, which can be applied to cryptocurrency markets\n",
    "* The paper contributes to wider debates in econophysics, such as probabilistic and statistical approaches and the development of links with mainstream financial models\n",
    "* Econophysics has been used to address a wide range of practical problems in finance and economics, including speculative bubbles and high-frequency trading\n",
    "* Cryptocurrency markets present legal, regulatory, and ethical challenges and have been extremely volatile\n",
    "* The paper develops an econophysics model for bubbles and crashes that can be fitted to empirical financial data\n",
    "* Negative bubbles are found in cryptocurrency markets, and evidence is found of a spillover effect from Ripple to Bitcoin\n",
    "* The paper develops a model to independently verify the impact of putative market shocks upon Bitcoin\n",
    "* Results suggest that cryptocurrency markets are complex and often misunderstood by academics and practitioners\n",
    "* Despite being a fast-moving and unconventional area, there is a wealth of statistical information available about Bitcoin and other digital currencies that renders academic study of the area entirely possible.\n",
    "* Coinmarketcap.com is a key data source used in previous academic studies and provides data about listed coins such as price, available supply, trade volume, and market capitalization.\n",
    "* In addition to providing timely information, coins listed on coinmarketcap.com must also satisfy rigorous assessment criteria, including being genuinely tradable and satisfying a transparency requirement.\n",
    "* It remains unclear whether Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies should be seen as an alternative currency or as a speculative asset, with some arguing that Bitcoin should be seen as a speculative commodity rather than a currency.\n",
    "* Bitcoin's prices appear to be particularly susceptible to market sentiments and dramatic boom-bust episodes, undermining the role that Bitcoin might play as a store of value.\n",
    "* The long-term sustainability of Bitcoin has also come under scrutiny, with some authors seeing the lack of a centralized governance body as an essential weakness, and concerns raised that its design flaws may ultimately make Bitcoin vulnerable to competing altcoins in the long-term.\n",
    "* Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies raise several important ethical issues, including concerns that the anonymity endowed by cryptocurrencies may encourage illegal activities, cybersecurity worries, and fears over the continued ability of governments to raise taxes.\n",

    "as well as the Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) methodology are the most frequently employed\n",
    "techniques for bubble detection and measurement. Based on much academic research, Bitcoin\n",
    "appears to have been in a bubble-phase since June 2015, while Ethereum, NEM, Stellar, Ripple,\n",
    "Litecoin and Dash have been denoted as possessing bubble-like characteristics since September\n",
    "2015. However, this latter group possess little academic evidence supporting the presence of\n",
    "bubbles since early 2018. An overall perspective is provided based on a robust bibliography\n",
    "based on large deviations of market quotes from fundamental values that can serve as a guide to\n",
    "policymakers, academics and investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubbles have existed across many differing investment assets, with research developing across a number of related strands\n",

    "Unsurprisingly, this has spurred substantial interest in bubble-formation within cryptocurrency markets (Frehen et al., 2013;\n",

    "of differentiating their nominal value from their fundamental value in a large extent (West, 1987; Diba and Grossman, 1988). It\n",
    "should be noted that the nominal value of an asset is defined as the market value by which it can be sold or bought whereas its\n",
    "fundamental value is lower and generally based on its costs of production. Continuous increases in the multiplicity through which nominal prices exceed fundamental values lead to explosive behaviour and the formation of bubbles. Such deviations from funda-\n",

    "Digital currencies have been an axis of interest with regards to the presence of a number of specific characteristics, such as their\n",
    "nature and functions and whether they constitute a commodity or fiat money. Baur et al. (2018) found that Bitcoin is a hybrid of\n",
    "commodity money and fiat money. While digital coins employ peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and open-source software in order to\n",
    "prevent double spending and bypass the need for intermediation by commercial banks (Dwyer, 2015). Most cryptocurrencies are\n",

    "the Appendix provide a brief overview of the studies investigated and the bubbles detected in these academic papers, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble formation has been a term that has received a number of alternative though not contradictory definitions throughout the\n",
    "years. A simple definition of bubbles can be presented as ‘systematic deviations of the market value from the fundamental value of the\n",
    "asset’, where the latter is defined as the net present value of the future cash flows emanating from it. Van Horne (1985) supported this\n",
    "definition, stating that ‘a balloon might be a better metaphor for certain financial promotions. It is blown up, to be sure, but not to the\n",
    "extent that it pops. The eventual deflation is less abrupt.’ Garber (1990) argued that the term ‘bubble is a fuzzy word filled with\n",
    "import but lacking any solid operational definition’ documenting that one should not try to define bubbles as just financial events, as\n",
    "we have just to date being unable to understand the exact driving forces within. The author considers that such deviations cannot be\n",
    "explained based on any of the fundamentals. O’Hara (2008) provided support to such a theory on bubbles, noting that they depend on\n",
    "combinations of the rationality or not of agents and markets. Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2013) identify that bubbles consist of: (a) a\n",
    "run-up phase that leads in formation of bubbles and imbalances; and (b) a crisis phase, where accumulated risk materialises and the\n",
    "crisis breaks out. Moreover, Shiller et al. (1984) reveals that asset markets are directed by mercurial investors acting on the basis of\n",
    "short-lived enthusiasms and bubbles. Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2013) described bubbles as dramatic price increases which lead to\n",
    "bursting, while Kindleberger and Aliber (2011) considered bubbles as fast increases in the market value of an asset and that the initial\n",
    "upwards spur triggers expectations of a series of price enlargements. This is what feeds elevated interest about that particular asset\n",
    "and results in higher demand for investment in it. This is the so-called ‘irrational exuberance’ in investors’ behaviour (Shiller, 2015).\n",
    "A standard pricing pattern arises for new investment assets, such as digital currencies. When a new form of liquidity is developed,\n",
    "the first coins of this currency are sold in a very high price. One should take into consideration that there is an upper limit in the\n",
    "quantity of supply of a large number of cryptocurrencies, for example Bitcoin will stop being produced when it reaches 21 million\n",
    "coins. This supply will continue to increase in decreasing steps until 2040 and then will remain at that level forever (Baur et al.,\n",
    "2018). Azariadis (1981) and Frehen et al. (2013) consider that the three most important historic bubbles have been; the Dutch ‘tulip\n",
    "mania,’ the South Sea bubble in England and the collapse of the Mississippi Company in France. These events are considered to have\n",
    "been the prominent landmarks in the financial economic events history as the vertical ascents in prices that took place had been\n",
    "phenomenal. Van Horne (1985), based on a large bulk of evidence regarding financial market anomalies, takes into consideration the\n",
    "possibility of bubbles and manias and argues that during the tulipmania a single bulb could be sold for many years’ salary. Garber\n",
    "(1990) believes that the Dutch experience of Tulipmania during the period 1634–7 was characterised by amazingly high prices of\n",
    "single bulbs of rare and prized varieties of tulips. Emphasis should be paid in that towards the most intense phase of the Tulipmania in\n",
    "the early 1637, just before the burst of this bubble, even common tulip varieties skyrocketed with approximately 2000% increases in prices within a month.\n",
    "According to Johannessen (2017), rampant speculation on the stock exchanges in the various Dutch towns based on the stock\n",
    "prices of tulip bulbs became a frequent phenomenon. It is noteworthy that the price of such a bulb was between 10 and 25 guilders in\n",
    "1612 whereas reached approximately 6650 guilders 25 years later due to collective optimism in the Dutch market. This optimism had\n",
    "been the product of institutional innovation (stock exchanges) and product innovation. Johannessen (2017) argued that the moti-\n",
    "vation for founding South Sea Company was the refinancing of the massive national debts that the British and French had acquired\n",
    "during the Spanish War of Succession. In no more than a decade, the share value of South Sea Company had reached the enormous\n",
    "amount of £ 200 million. Its rally in prices was based on attracting investors from France by promising enormous profits in the French\n",
    "colonies in North America. It is widely accepted that the South Sea bubble (1720) was generated as many investors from the\n",
    "Continent had purchased South Sea Company shares in London (Brunnermeier and Oehmke, 2013). As there was not in reality any\n",
    "perspective of significant trade and profits, the company's value decreased and fell to lower levels than before the start of the bubble.\n",
    "The Mississippi bubble (1719–20) was the result of Compagnie d’Occident (‘Company of the West’) that John Law created in order to\n",
    "have the exclusive privileges to develop the vast French territories in the Mississippi River valley of North America. This company had\n",
    "the monopoly power over the French tobacco and African slave trades and Law used it for selling its shares to the public in exchange\n",
    "for state-issued public securities. The mania of the public to sell debt for shares of the company weakened when inflation rose too\n",
    "high because of over-issuing of public debt. Thereby, the bubble collapsed and triggered a crash in equity markets in France. Frehen\n",
    "et al. (2013) provide evidence that all three bubbles had innovation and irrational investor exuberance as key drivers of bubble\n",
    "expectations. They reject clientele-based theories that attribute emphasis to bubble-riding and short-sales restrictions.\n",

    "3. Methodological approaches for defining, detecting and measuring bubbles\n",
    "3.1. Main existing literature on detecting bubbles\n",
    "Academic work used for the process of identifying bubbles in asset prices based on fundamental values, possesses roots in the asset\n",
    "pricing model of Lucas Jr. (1978). This has been the axis on which a number of important contributors have developed econometric\n",
    "methodologies in order to test for bubble behaviour in prices. Blanchard and Watson (1982) argue that bubbles can follow many\n",
    "types of processes and that certain bubbles lead to violation of variance bounds implied by a class of rational expectations models.\n",
    "Shiller et al. (1984) support that social movements and habits in specific time periods are responsible for increases in asset prices.\n",
    "Investing incentives and asset price fluctuations are due to observations of participants in the market and to human nature. Tirole\n",
    "(1985) reveals that there are three conditions for bubble creation: durability, scarcity and common beliefs. He argues that scarcity is\n",
    "based on new units having the same price as old ones and claims that limited supply may prevent bubbles. This could be very intuitive\n",
    "as regards Bitcoin. Furthermore, he distinguishes between the financial bubble, which depends on market price, and the real bubble\n",
    "that is established by fundamentals of this market. Notably, he supports that overlapping generations models should focus on\n",
    "speculative assets rather than money. Evans (1989) argued that in rational expectations models sunspots and other ‘rational bubble’\n",
    "solutions present only weak or no expectational stability and that in linear models there is at most one strongly expectational stable\n",
    "solution.\n",
    "Diba and Grossman (1988) support the view that stock prices do not contain explosive price bubbles, moreover, claiming that it is\n",
    "impossible for negative rational bubbles in stock prices to exist, thereby if a bubble bursts then there is no opportunity that it will ever\n",
    "restart. Froot and Obstfeld (1989) focused on rational intrinsic bubbles dependent only on dividends, that is bubbles that derive all\n",
    "their fluctuations from exogenous economic fundamentals but not from extraneous factors. They find evidence in favour of bubbles in\n",
    "the US stock market that are difficult to be explained by alternative models. Gurkaynak (2008) documents that asset bubble tests\n",
    "cannot manage to offer adequate information about the existence or not of bubbles. He finds that inclusion of model assumptions\n",
    "about time-varying discount rates, risk aversion or structural breaks permit the appearance of bubbles only in a very weak extent.\n",
    "Furthermore, there is no way to distinguish bubbles from time-varying or regime-switching fundamentals. Overall, the author argues\n",

    "Rational bubbles appear when asset prices keep rising due to investors’ beliefs that there will be a possibility to sell the overvalued\n",
    "asset at a higher price in the future (Flood and Hodrick, 1990). As investors are aware of the risk of bubble bursting at some future\n",
    "point in time, they require compensation for bearing that risk which gets higher as time passes because risk becomes higher. The\n",
    "continuing requirement for higher profits leads to overgrowing of prices and finally the bubble bursts. Dale et al. (2005) argued that\n",
    "intrinsic rational bubbles are formed when investors systematically and continuously conduct wrong estimations of asset funda-\n",
    "mentals. This is more common when it comes to advanced technology products where it is more difficult to determine the exact\n",
    "fundamental value. Crashes are usually the result of informational dynamics after long periods of price increases have taken place.\n",
    "Extrinsic rational bubbles, also called as ‘sunspots’, occur when rational investors have to confront large levels of uncertainty con-\n",
    "cerning the economic environment. This is what leads investor to ascribe a value – with regards to price prediction to endogenously determine factors that do not have both a real or significant influence on fundamental values of assets. The main source of extrinsic\n",
    "rational bubbles is reliance on misinformation that results in poor management skills.\n",
    "3.3. Approaches for detecting and measuring bubbles\n",
    "No consensus is apparent as regards the tracing and measurement of price bubbles. Rational bubbles could appear in the form of\n",
    "deterministic time trends, as explosive AR(1) processes or even more complex stochastic processes. Among others, there have been\n",
    "four principal alternative approaches in order to define bubbles. The first view about defining bubbles is more traditional and lies on\n",
    "the comparison between the fundamental value and the nominal value of the underlying asset. It should be noted that the funda-\n",
    "mental value is defined as the present value of the payoffs deriving from the assets since all relevant information has been taken into\n",
    "consideration (Taipalus, 2012). Thereby, the asset-pricing approach considers that bubbles exist when the nominal value that co-\n",
    "incides with market value is not equal to the fundamental value of the asset.\n",
    "Another approach for modelling the fundamental value is provided by Foster and Wild (1999) by using the sigmoid (or logistic)\n",
    "curve approach. This methodology is beneficial when aiming to capture the different phases in the evolution of a bubble, such as the\n",
    "expansion phase, the inflexion phase and the saturation phase. All three are considered typical phases during price bubble formation.\n",
    "The expansion phase presents positive growth, the inflexion phase is characterised by stability whereas the saturation phase re-\n",
    "presents a fall in prices. Tracing the date of launch of the saturation phase is what this approach wants to succeed. It is worth noting\n",
    "that the period of positive growth is in practice not equal to that of negative growth in prices. The main drawback of adopting the\n",
    "sigmoid curve approach is its doubtful effectiveness in measurement during multiple bubbles.\n",
    "A methodology suitable for testing about single or multiple bubbles is offered by the Markov-switching Augmented Dickey-Fuller\n",
    "(MSADF) unit root test that detects explosive autoregressive roots. This procedure has been proposed by Hall et al. (1999) in order to\n",
    "track alterations from non-bubble to bubble regimes. The main drawback of this method is the difficulty in tracing whether high\n",
    "volatility or explosive autoregressive behaviour exists in regimes. Among the popular methodologies for detecting price bubbles\n",
    "could be found the Phillips et al. (2014) and Phillips et al. (2015) procedures. This is about a bubble test based on the assumption that\n",
    "bubbles follow a mildly explosive behaviour, that is an autoregressive root θ = 1 + gT−m, where g is positive and m, c parameters lie\n",
    "in the interval between 0 and 1. This test abides by the theory that suggests differences in tendencies of prices during upwards phases\n",
    "in comparison to tendencies in downswing periods. Thereby, sub-martingale behaviour in bullish markets is considered to be dif-\n",

    "### Key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bubble formation has received different definitions, but a simple one is systematic deviations of the market value from the fundamental value of the asset.\n",
    "- Such deviations cannot be explained based on any of the fundamentals, but rather depend on combinations of the rationality or not of agents and markets.\n",
    "- Bubbles consist of a run-up phase that leads to formation of bubbles and imbalances, and a crisis phase where accumulated risk materializes, and the crisis breaks out.\n",
    "- Asset markets are directed by mercurial investors acting on the basis of short-lived enthusiasms and bubbles.\n",
    "- Bubbles are dramatic price increases which lead to bursting.\n",
    "- Tulipmania, the South Sea bubble, and the collapse of the Mississippi Company are the three most important historic bubbles.\n",
    "- During Tulipmania, a single bulb could be sold for many years' salary, and even common tulip varieties skyrocketed with approximately 2000% increases in prices within a month.\n",
    "- The South Sea bubble was generated by attracting investors from France by promising enormous profits in the French colonies in North America, but there was no prospect of significant trade and profits.\n",
    "- The Mississippi bubble was the result of Compagnie d'Occident created by John Law, which had the monopoly power over the French tobacco and African slave trades, and collapsed when inflation rose too high because of over-issuing of public debt.\n",
    "- The existing literature on detecting bubbles is rooted in the asset pricing model of Lucas Jr. (1978), with Blanchard and Watson (1982) arguing that bubbles can follow many types of processes, and Shiller et al. (1984) supporting that social movements and habits in specific time periods are responsible for increases in asset prices.\n",
    "- Tirole (1985) reveals that there are three conditions for bubble creation: durability, scarcity, and common beliefs. - He distinguishes between the financial bubble, which depends on market price, and the real bubble that is established by the fundamentals of the market.\n",
    "- Diba and Grossman (1988) argue that stock prices do not contain explosive price bubbles, and Froot and Obstfeld (1989) focused on rational intrinsic bubbles dependent only on dividends, finding evidence in favour of bubbles in the US stock market that are difficult to be explained by alternative models.\n",
    "- Gurkaynak (2008) finds that asset bubble tests cannot offer adequate information about the existence or not of bubbles, and when bubble detection tests indicate the existence of a bubble, we could be far from certain that this bubble exists.\n",
    "- Rational bubbles appear when asset prices keep rising due to investors' beliefs that there will be a possibility to sell the overvalued asset at a higher price in the future. Intrinsic rational bubbles are formed when investors systematically and continuously conduct wrong estimations of asset fundamentals, while extrinsic rational bubbles occur when rational investors have to confront large levels of uncertainty concerning the economic environment.\n",
    "- No consensus exists as regards the tracing and measurement of price bubbles. Among others, there have been four principal alternative approaches in order to define bubbles: the asset-pricing approach, the sigmoid curve approach, the fundamental-value approach, and the mispricing approach.\n",
    "- Empirical papers investigate bubble price dynamics in cryptocurrency markets, with emphasis on Bitcoin.\n",
    "- Cryptocurrencies contain pricing inefficiencies, persistence, correlation or isolation from other traded assets, news response, derivative development, contagion effects, evidence of price clustering, pricing bubbles, regulatory ambiguity, and exceptional levels of both complex and uncomplex fraud.\n",
    "- Concern placed on pricing efficiency, market dynamics, and the potential presence of a pricing bubble.\n",
    "- Marginal cost of production, Metcalfe's Law, portfolio theory, search intensity and gold returns, liquidity risks, Tether issuance, under-pricing of ICOs, and the process of banning Bitcoin are investigated.\n",
    "- Interactions between cryptocurrencies and other more traditional financial markets is a key area of research.\n",
    "- Scepticism exists regarding the potential for illegality and malpractice, with estimates that $76 billion of illegal activity per year involve Bitcoin.\n",
    "- Companies attempting to take advantage of ‘crypto-exuberance’ must be considered.\n",
    "- Fundamental issue of what exactly is the price of one unit of cryptocurrency remains.\n",
    "- Alternative estimation frameworks are used to detect price bubbles in Bitcoin markets\n",

    "blockchain technology that underlies its peer-to-peer global payment network.1Since its techno-libertarian beginnings, which envisioned Bitcoin as an alternative to the central banking system,Bitcoin has experienced super-exponential growth. Fuelled by the rise of Bitcoin, a myriad of othercryptocurrencies have erupted into the mainstream with a range of highly disruptive use-casesforeseen. Cryptocurrencies have become an emerging asset class [3]. At the end of 2017, the price ofBitcoin peaked at almost 20 000 USD, and the combined market capitalization of cryptocurrenciesreached around 800 billion USD.The explosive growth of Bitcoin intensified debates about the cryptocurrency’s intrinsic orfundamental value. While many pundits have claimed that Bitcoin is a scam and its value willeventually fall to zero, others believe that further enormous growth and adoption await, oftencomparing to the market capitalization of monetary assets, or stores of value. By comparing Bitcoin togold, an analogy that is based on the digital scarcity that is built into the Bitcoin protocol, somemarkets analysts predicted Bitcoin prices as a high as 10 million per Bitcoin [4]. Nobel laureate andbubble expert, Robert Shiller, epitomized this ambiguity of Bitcoin price predictions when he stated,at the 2018 Davos World Economic Forum, that ‘bitcoin could be here for 100 years but it’s morelikely to totally collapse’ and, ‘you just put an upper bound on [bitcoin] with the value of the world’smoney supply. But that upper bound is awfully big. So it can be anywhere between zero and there’ [5].There is an emerging academic literature on cryptocurrency valuations [6–16] and their growthmechanisms [17–19]. Naturally, relationships exist between Bitcoin value, adoption and online activity(searches, tweets, etc.). Macro-economic variables should also determine the attractiveness of thecryptocurrency (e.g. as a hedge against failed sovereign monetary systems). However, existence oflarge bubbles and crashes—being radically non-stationary with nonlinear tipping point dynamics—makes modelling these mechanisms difficult and risky with stationary linear models and conventionaleconometric techniques.Many of these studies attribute some technical feature of the Bitcoin protocol, such as the ‘proof-of-work’ system on which the Bitcoin cryptocurrency is based, as a source of value.2In [21], it was evenargued that Bitcoin has value because people are mining it, rather than the contrary. However, as hasbeen proposed by former Wall Street analyst Tom Lee [4], an early academic proposal [22], by nowwidely discussed within cryptocurrency communities, is that an alternative valuation of Bitcoin can bebased on its network of users. In the 1980s, Metcalfe proposed that the value of a network isproportional to the square of the number of nodes [23]. This may also be called the network effect,and has been found to hold for many networked systems. If Metcalfe’s Law holds here, fundamentalvaluation of Bitcoin may in fact be far easier than valuation of equities3—which relies on variousmultiples, such as price-to-earnings, price-to-book or price-to-cash-flow ratios—and will thereforeadmit an indication of bubbles.Although it seems relatively obvious that bubbles exist within the cryptocurrency market, in financeand economics, the possibility of financial bubbles is often excluded based on market efficiencyrationalization,4which assume an unpredictable market price, for instance following a kind ofgeometrical random walk (e.g. [27]). By sharp contrast, Didier Sornette and co-workers claim thatbubbles exist and are ubiquitous. Moreover, they can be accurately described by a nonlinear trendcalled the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, potentially with highly persistent, butultimately mean-reverting, errors. The LPPLS model combines two well-documented empirical andphenomenological features of bubbles (see [28] for a recent review): \n",
    "\n",
    " (1) the price exhibits a transient faster-than-exponential growth (i.e. where the growth rate itself isgrowing)—resulting from positive feedbacks like herding [29]—that is modelled by a hyperbolicpower law with a singularity in finite time, i.e. endogenously approaching an infinite value andtherefore necessitating a crash or correction before the singularity is reached;\n",
    " \n",
    " (2) it is also decorated with accelerating log-periodic volatility fluctuations, embodying spirals ofcompeting expectations of higher returns (bullish) and an impending crash (bearish) [30,31]. Suchlog-periodic fluctuations are ubiquitous in complex systems with a hierarchical structure and alsoappear spontaneously as a result of the interplay between (i) inertia, (ii) nonlinear positive and(iii) nonlinear negative feedback loops [32].\n",
    " \n",
    "The model thus characterizes a process in which, as speculative frenzy intensifies, the bubble maturestowards its endogenous critical point, and becomes increasingly unstable, such that any smalldisturbance can trigger a crash. This has been further formalized in the so-called JLS model where therate of return accelerates towards a singularity, compensated by the growing crash hazard rate [30,33],providing a generalized return–risk relationship. We emphasize that one should not focus on theinstantaneous and rather unpredictable trigger itself, but monitor the increasingly unstable state of thebubbly market, and prepare for a correction.Other studies have considered bubbly dynamics within Bitcoin: In [18] (followed by Garcia &Schweitzer  [34]),  a  quad-variate  autoregression  was  introduced.  Finding  evidence  of  positivefeedbacks between price and online activity, potential for bubble formation was suggested. However,the model focuses on moderate short-term effects, and integrates to produce a linear price trend—neither producing large bubbles, nor a justified fundamental value. The LPPLS model has beenapplied to Bitcoin bubbles (e.g. [35–37]). Notably, in [36] it was claimed that the fundamental valueof Bitcoin is zero. Further, explosive unit-roots have been detected in the Bitcoin value (e.g. [37–39]).These tests may identify bubbles—insofar as bubbles can be explained by a consistent mildlyexplosive unit-root, while perhaps also allowing for a log-linear trend—but are not specific [40], andhave limited descriptive and predictive power.Here, we combine—as a fundamental measure—a generalized Metcalfe’s Law and—as a technicalmeasure—the LPPLS model, in order to diagnose bubbles in Bitcoin. When both measures coincide,this provides a convincing indication of a bubble and impending correction. If, in hindsight, suchsignals are followed by a correction similar to that suggested, they provide compelling evidence that abubble and crash did indeed take place.This paper is organized as follows. In the first part, we document a generalized Metcalfe’s Lawdescribing the growth of the population of active Bitcoin users. We show that the generalizedMetcalfe’s Law provides a support level, and that the ratio of market capitalization to ‘the Metcalfevalue’ gives a relative valuation ratio. On this basis, we identify a current substantial but notunprecedented overvaluation in the price of Bitcoin. In the second part of the paper, we unearth auniversal super-exponential bubble signature in four Bitcoin bubbles, which corresponds to the LPPLSmodel with a reasonable range of parameters. The LPPLS model is shown to provide advancewarning, in particular with confidence intervals for the critical bursting time based on profilelikelihood. An LPPLS fitting algorithm is presented, allowing for selection of the bubble start time,and offering an interval for the crash time, in a probabilistically sound way. We conclude the paperwith a brief discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we have combined a generalized Metcalfe’s Law—providing an approximate fundamentalvalue based on network characteristics—with the LPPLS model—to develop a rich diagnostic of bubblesand their crashes that have punctuated the cryptocurrency’s history. In doing so, we were able todiagnose four distinct bubbles, being periods of high overvaluation and LPPLS-like trajectories, whichwere followed by crashes or strong corrections. Although the height and length of the bubbles varysubstantially, when scaled to the same log-height and length, a near-universal super-exponentialgrowth is documented. This is in radical contrast to the view that (crypto-)markets follow a randomwalk and are essentially unpredictable.Further, in addition to being able to identify bubbles in hindsight, given the consistent LPPLS bubblecharacteristics and demonstrated advance warning potential, the LPPLS can be used to provide ex antepredictions. For instance, a reasonable confidence interval for the critical time indicates a high hazard forcorrection in that neighbourhood, as any minor event could topple the unstable market. The success ofsuch an approach was shown for the large 2017 bubble. Of course, false positives and misses are possible,but somewhat ambiguous in view of the limited number of large bubbles—and also dependent upon thespecific decision rule being used (potentially including human judgement). Further, massive exogenousshocks, although rare, could occur at any time, and the LPPLS model can provide no warning there.Focusing on the outlook for Bitcoin, the active user data indicate a shrinking growth rate, which arange of parametrizations of our generalized Metcalfe’s Law translates into slowing growth in marketcapitalization. Further, our Metcalfe-based analysis indicates current support levels for the Bitcoinmarket in the range of 22–44 billion USD, at least a factor of four less than the current level. On thisbasis alone, the current market resembles that of early 2014, which was followed by a year ofsideways and downward movement. Given the high correlation of cryptocurrencies, the short-termmovements of other cryptocurrencies are likely to be affected by corrections in Bitcoin (and viceversa), regardless of their own relative valuations.\n",

    "The Log Periodic Power Law (LPPL) proposed by A. Johansen, O. Ledoit and D. Sornette (JLS) [5–7,3] proposes a way out of\n",

    "recent papers [28,29] that discuss pros and cons of past works on the JLS model. While the assessment about the advances\n",
    "and limitations of the model itself is beyond the scope of the present paper, let us however mention that major critiques\n",
    "have been already addressed in earlier works. In particular, Ref. [30] specifically addresses the criticism of Ref. [23] by using\n",
    "the Bayesian factor as the criterion to compare the JLS model with the geometric random walk model. Ref. [31] adds to this\n",
    "general discussion by demonstrating the superiority of models involving a stochastic finite time singularity. Finally, Ref. [32]\n",
    "presents a review of the state of the art on the Johansen–Ledoit–Sornette bubble model, which constitutes the simplest and\n",
    "most used version of the LPPL model for empirical calibrations.\n",
    "The LPPL model in its original form presents a function of 3 linear and 4 nonlinear parameters that should be estimated by\n",
    "fitting this function to the log-price time series. Calibrating the LPPL model has always been prone to difficulties due to the\n",
    "relatively large number of parameters that must be estimated and the strong nonlinear structure of the equation. Most of\n",
    "the fitting procedures that have been used until now subordinate the 3 linear parameters to the 4 nonlinear parameters [6].\n",
    "The resulting search space with 4 nonlinear parameters has a very complex quasi-periodic structure with multiple minima.\n",
    "The determination of the global minimum requires using some metaheuristic methods such as taboo search [6,33] or genetic\n",
    "algorithm [34]. However, even these methods do not ensure that the correct solution is discovered. In addition, how to deal\n",
    "with the existence of many possible competing degenerate solutions has not been satisfactorily solved.\n",
    "In the present paper, we propose a fundamental revision of the formulation of the LPPL model, that transforms it from\n",
    "a function of 3 linear and 4 nonlinear parameters into a representation with 4 linear and 3 nonlinear parameters. This\n",
    "transformation significantly decreases the complexity of the fitting procedure and improves its stability tremendously\n",
    "because the modified cost function is now characterized by good smooth properties with in general a single minimum in the\n",
    "case where the model is appropriate to the empirical data. As an additional step, we propose a subordination procedure that\n",
    "slaves two of the nonlinear parameters to what can be considered to be the most crucial nonlinear parameter, the critical\n",
    "time tc defined as the end of the bubble. The critical time is indeed the prize of the whole forecasting exercise: the sooner a\n",
    "bubble is identified, that is, the further away is tc\n",
    "from the present time, the better it is for policy makers to take appropriate\n",
    "actions. Of course, it goes without saying that the validity and reliability of the results should be established carefully before\n",
    "any action is taken. We note that this additional subordination decreases further the complexity of the search and provides\n",
    "an intuitive representation of the results of the calibration. With our proposed methodology, metaheuristics are not longer\n",
    "necessary and one can resort solely to rigorous controlled local search algorithms, leading to dramatic increase in efficiency.\n",
    "The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the idea behind the LPPL model and presents its original form.\n",
    "Traditional fitting procedures applied to the LPPL model are described in Section 3. Section 4 presents the proposed\n",
    "modification of the model and explains the new subordination procedure. Section 5 concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper provides an important parameter transformation for the log-periodic power law (LPPL) equation of the\n",
    "Johansen–Ledoit–Sornette model of financial bubbles which, in its original form, is parametrized by 3 linear and 4 nonlinear\n",
    "parameters. Diagnosing a bubble and forecasting its burst (that usually results in dramatic change of regime, such as large\n",
    "crash or change of the average growth rate) require calibration of the LPPL model and estimation these 7 parameters from\n",
    "the observed price time-series. Though 3 linear parameters can be easily slaved to the 4 nonlinear ones, the resulting\n",
    "4-dimensional search space still keeps a complex structure with quasi-periodicity and multiple minima. The complex\n",
    "structure of the parameter space does not allow one to use local search algorithms and requires more sophisticated methods,\n",
    "such as taboo search or genetic algorithms. The implementation and the tuning of these methods were the main source of\n",
    "complexity in the calibration of the LPPL model.\n",
    "The reformulation of the LPPL equation proposed here allows one to re-parametrize the model in terms of 4 linear and\n",
    "only 3 nonlinear parameters. This has two very important consequences: (i) reduction of the dimensionality of the nonlinear\n",
    "optimization problem from a 4-dimensional to a 3-dimensional space and (ii) elimination of the quasi-periodicity and of the\n",
    "multiple local minima of the cost function. An empirical case study performed in this paper using the SSE Composite index\n",
    "from July 1999 to May 2011 shows that, even in the worst cases that were studied, we found no more than 3 competing\n",
    "minima. Most cases that are qualified to be in a bubble regime give only one minimum, and the occurrence of a second or\n",
    "third minimum usually correspond to poor fits of the LPPL function on the empirical price time-series. This simplification\n",
    "allows us to use rigorous local search methods in the fitting procedure without introducing any metaheuristics.\n",
    "As an additional step, we have proposed a subordination procedure that slaves two of the nonlinear parameters, namely\n",
    "the growth rate exponent m and the log-frequency ω, to the critical time tc that defines the end of the bubble and is\n",
    "considered as the most crucial parameter. This additional subordination provides the following benefits: (i) further decrease\n",

    "Kindleberger (2000) and Sornette (2003b) have identified the following generic scenario developing in five acts, which is\n",
    "common to all historical bubbles: displacement, take-off, exuberance, critical stage and crash. For the Chinese bubble starting\n",
    "in 2005, the “displacement” and “take-off” can be associated with the split share structure reform of listed companies in\n",
    "2005. Before the reform, only about one-third of the shares of any listed company in the Chinese stock market were tradable.\n",
    "The other two-third shares were non-tradable (not allowed to be exchanged and to circulate between investors), and were\n",
    "owned by the state and by legal entities. The tradable stocks acquired therefore a significant liquidity premium, and were\n",
    "valued much higher than their non-tradable siblings, notwithstanding the fact that both gave the same privilege to their\n",
    "owners in terms of voting rights and dividends. In 2001, the Chinese stock market entered an anti-bubble phase (Zhou and\n",
    "Sornette, 2004) with the Shanghai stock exchange composite index falling from its then historical high 2245 on 24 June\n",
    "2001 to the historical low on 6 June 2005. On 29 April 2005, the China Securities Regulatory Commission launched the pilot\n",
    "reform of the split share structure. The split share structure reform is defined as the process to eliminate the discrepancies in\n",
    "the A-share transfer system via a negotiation mechanism to balance the interests of non-tradable shareholders and tradable\n",
    "shareholders. On 4 September 2005, the China Securities Regulatory Commission enacted the Administrative Measures on\n",
    "the Split Share Structure Reform of Listed Companies,\n",
    "1 which took effect immediately. It is widely accepted that the split\n",
    "share structure reform was a turning point which triggered and catalyzed the recovery of the Chinese stock market from its\n",
    "previous bearish regime. For the Chinese bubble starting in November 2008, the “take-off” can be associated with China’s\n",
    "policy reaction on the global financial crisis, with a huge RMB 4 trillion stimulus plan and aggressive loan growth by financial\n",
    "institutions.\n",
    "Here, we present an ex-post analysis of what we identified earlier in their respective epochs as being two significant\n",
    "bubbles developing in the major Chinese stock markets, the first one from 2005 to 2007 and the second one from 2008 to\n",
    "2009. The organized stock market in mainland China is composed of two stock exchanges, the Shanghai stock exchange\n",

    "From November 2008 until the end of July 2009, the Chinese stock markets had been rising dramatically. By calibrating the\n",

    "\n",
    "Our main method for detecting bubbles and predicting the critical time tc when the bubble will end either in a crash or\n",

    "U.S. stock market would follow a downward log-periodic pattern (Sornette and Zhou, 2002). How can one make sense of\n",
    "these contradictory claims? We summarize the present state of the art as follows.\n",
    "1. Prediction of the end of bubbles should not be confused with predictions based on extrapolation, such as those\n",
    "associated with antibubbles. There is a confusion between predicting crashes, on the one hand, and predicting the\n",
    "continuation of an “antibubble” bearish regime, on the other hand. It seems that both Lux (2009) and Rosser (2008) do\n",
    "not distinguish between these two issues, when they focus on the failure of the antibubble prediction in Sornette and\n",
    "Zhou (2002) and conclude that “Sornette and his collaborators failed to forecast future crashes.”\n",
    "There is indeed a fundamental difference between, on the one hand, (i) the prediction of the end of a bubble analyzed\n",
    "here, which is characterized by its critical time tc and, on the other hand, (ii) the extrapolation of an “antibubble” pattern.\n",
    "This difference is similar to that between (i) the prediction of the approximate parturition time of a foetus on the basis\n",
    "of the recording of key variables obtained during its maturation in the uterus of his mother and (ii) the prediction of\n",
    "the death of this individual later in old age from an extrapolation of medical variables recorded during his adult life. The\n",
    "former (i) is associated with the maturation phase (the financial bubble versus the uterus–foetus development). It has a\n",
    "rather well-defined critical time which signals the transition to a new regime (crash/stagnation/bearish versus birth). In\n",
    "contrast, the latter (ii) may be influenced by a variety of factors, particularly exogenous, which may shorten or lengthen\n",
    "the life of the antibubble or of the individual. One should thus separate the statistics of successes and failures in the\n",
    "prediction of bubbles on the one hand and in the prediction of continuation of LPPL antibubble patterns on the other\n",
    "Z.-Q. Jiang et al. / Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 74 (2010) 149–162 161\n",
    "hand. This was the spirit of the experiment proposed by Sornette and Zhou (2002) to test the distinct hypothesis that\n",
    "bearish regimes following a market peak could be predicted when associated with LPPL patterns.\n",
    "2. Intrinsic limits of the prediction of the end of an antibubble. For the reasons just mentioned, it is still an open problem\n",
    "to determine when an antibubble ends. Our methods show that one cannot avoid a delay of about 6 months before\n",
    "identifying the end of an antibubble (Zhou and Sornette, 2005). This is a partial explanation for the failure of the 2002\n",
    "antibubble prediction (Sornette and Zhou, 2002).\n",
    "3. Track record of the antibubble method. However, one should not forget that, taken as a distinct class separated from that\n",
    "of diagnosing bubbles and their ends, the predictions based on the antibubble method can count several past successes:\n",
    "(a) on the Nikkei antibubble (Johansen and Sornette, 1999b, 2000) and (b) on the Chinese stock market antibubble (Zhou\n",
    "and Sornette, 2004), in addition to the failure mentioned above. This track record is insufficient to conclude. More tests\n",
    "in real time should be performed and rigorous methods developed to assess the statistical significance of short catalogs\n",
    "of success/failure predictions can be applied, based on “roulette” approaches (see Chapter 9 in Sornette (2003b), Bayes’\n",
    "theorem (Johansen and Sornette, 2000) and Neyman–Pearson or error diagrams (Molchan, 1990, 1997)).\n",
    "4. What we learned from the antibubble prediction failure. Lux (2009) and Rosser (2008) are right to stress that the 2002\n",
    "antibubble prediction of Sornette and Zhou (2002) failed. However, a post-mortem analysis in Zhou and Sornette (2005)\n",
    "has revealed an interesting fact. While the prediction failed when the S&P500 is valued in U.S. dollars, it becomes quite\n",
    "accurate when expressed in euro or British pounds (Zhou and Sornette, 2005). A plausible interpretation would be that\n",
    "the energetic Federal Reserver monetary policy of decreasing its lead rate from 6.5% in 2000 to 1% in 2003 boosted the\n",
    "stock market in local currency from 2003 on, but has degraded the dollar, so that the net effect was that the value of the\n",
    "US stock market from an international reference point was unfolding as expected from the analysis of Sornette and Zhou\n",
    "(2002). We do not claim that this changed the failure into a success. Instead, it illustrates the effect of monetary feedbacks\n",
    "that have to be included in improved models incorporating fundamental factors, for instance in the spirit of Zhou and\n",
    "Sornette (2006a).\n",
    "5. Track record for diagnosing bubbles and their ends. Our group has announced advanced prediction (not just in retrospect) of bubbles and their end (often a crash). The status of these predictions as of 2002 has been discussed in details in\n",
    "Chapter 9 of Sornette (2003b)’s book. As mentioned above, subsequent successes include the predictions of the peak in\n",
    "mid-2004 of the real-estate bubble in the UK by Zhou and Sornette (2003a), of the peak in mid-2006 of the US housing\n",
    "bubble by Zhou and Sornette (2006b) and of the peak in July 2008 of the global oil bubble by Sornette et al. (2009). The\n",
    "present analysis on two bubbles in the Chinese market provide additional evidence for the relevance of LPPL patterns in\n",
    "the diagnostic of bubbles.\n",
    "6. Recent improvements in methodology. While the core model (or forecasting system) has not changed much since\n",
    "the late-1990s, several new developments used here allow us to quantify more accurately both the reliability and the\n",
    "uncertainties. These improvements include multi-window analysis, probability estimates, and a consistent LPPL rational\n",
    "expectation model with mean-reverting residuals. Note that the more recent bubble in the Chinese indexes was detected\n",
    "and its end or change of regime was predicted independently by two groups (the first four authors from academia on\n",
    "the one hand and the last two authors from industry on the other hand) with similar results, showing that the model\n",
    "has been well-documented and can be replicated by industrial practitioners. In addition, we stress that the method relies\n",
    "essentially on the competition between the positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative\n",
    "feedback spirals of crash expectations (Ide and Sornette, 2002), which is at the origin of the acceleration oscillations. In\n",
    "the spirit of Lux and Marchesi (1999) and of Gallegati et al. (in press), this is accounted for in heterogeneous agent models\n",
    "by including non-linear fundamental investment styles competing with non-linear momentum trading styles (Ide and\n",
    "Sornette, 2002). The initial JLS model of Johansen et al. (1999, 2000a) was based on a conventional neoclassical model\n",
    "assuming a homogeneous rational agent, but it also enriched this set-up by introducing heterogeneous noise traders\n",
    "driving a crash hazard rate. More recently, Lin et al. (2009) have considered an alternative framework which extends the\n",
    "JSL model to account for behavioral herding by using a behavioral stochastic discount factor approach, with self-consistent\n",
    "mean-reversal residuals.\n",
    "In conclusion, given all the above, we feel this technique is the basis of a prediction platform, which we are actively\n",
    "developing, motivated by the conviction that this is the only way to make scientific progress in this delicate and crucial\n",
    "domain of great societal importance, as illustrated by the 2007–2009 financial and economic crisis (Sornette and Woordard,\n",

    "## CRASHES AS CRITICAL POINTS\n",
    "ANDERS JOHANSEN, OLIVIER LEDOIT, and DIDIER SORNETTE, 2000\n",
    "\n",
    "We study a rational expectation model of bubbles and crashes. The model has two components: (1) our key assumption is that a crash may be caused by local self-reinforcing imitation between noise traders. If the tendency for noise traders to imitate their nearest neighbors increases up to a certain point called the \"critical\" point, all noise traders may place the same order (sell) at the same time, thus causing a crash. The interplay between the progressive strengthening of imitation and the ubiquity of noise is characterized by the hazard rate, i.e. the probability per unit time that the crash will happen in the next instant if it has not happened yet. (2) Since the crash is not a certain deterministic outcome of the bubble, it remains rational for traders to remain invested provided they are compensated by a higher rate of growth of the bubble for taking the risk of a crash. Our model distinguishes between the end of the bubble and the time of the crash: the rational expectation constraint has the specific implication that the date of the crash must be random. The theoretical death of the bubble is not the time of the crash because the crash could happen at any time before, even though this is not very likely. The death of the bubble is the most probable time for the crash. There also exists a finite probability of attaining the end of the bubble without crash. Our model has specific predictions about the presence of certain critical log-periodic patterns in pre-crash prices, associated with the deterministic components of the bubble mechanism. We provide empirical evidence showing that these patterns were indeed present before the crashes of 1929, 1962 and 1987 on Wall Street and the 1997 crash on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. These results are compared with statistical tests on synthetic data.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The subprime solution : how today's global financial crisis happened, and what to do about it\n",
    "Robert Shiller\n",
    "\n",
    "The subprime crisis is the name for what a historic turning point in our economy and our culture. It is, at its core, the result of the deflating of a speculative bubble in the housing market that began in the United States in 2006 and has now cascaded across many other countries in the form of financial failures and a global credit crunch. The forces unleashed by the subprime crisis will probably run rampant for years, threatening more and more collateral damage. The disruption in our credit markets is already of historic proportions and will have important economic impacts. More importantly, this crisis has set in motion fundamental societal changes—changes that affect our consumer habits, our values, our relatedness to each other. From now on we will all be conducting our lives and doing business with each other a little bit differently.\n",
    "Allowing these destructive changes to proceed unimpeded could cause damage not only to the economy but to the social fabric—the trust and optimism people feel for each other and for their shared institutions and ways of life—for decades to come. The social fabric itself is so hard to measure that it is easily overlooked in favor of smaller, more discrete, elements and details. But the social fabric is indeed at risk and should be central to our attention as we respond to the subprime crisis.\n",
    "History proves the importance of economic policies for preserving the social fabric. Europe after World War I was seriously damaged by one peculiar economic arrangement: the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty, which ended the war, imposed on Germany punitive reparations far beyond its ability to pay. John Maynard Keynes\n",
    "9\n",
    "resigned in protest from the British delegation at Versailles and, in 1919, wrote The Economic Consequences of the Peace, which predicted that the treaty would result in disaster. Keynes was largely ignored, the treaty remained in force, and indeed Germany never was able to pay the penalties imposed. The disaster he had predicted in fact came about—in the form of intense resentment and, a generation later, World War II.\n",
    "A comparable disaster—albeit one not of quite the same magnitude—is brewing today, as similar concerns are hammering at our psyches. Once again, many people, unable to repay their debts, are being pursued aggressively by creditors. Once again, they often feel that the situation is not of their own making, but the product of forces beyond their control. Once again, they see once-trusted economic institutions collapsing around them. Once again, they feel that they were lied to—fed overly optimistic stories that encouraged them to take excessive risks.\n",
    "It is impossible to predict the nature and extent of the damage that the current economic and social dysphoria and disorder will create. But a good part of it will likely be measured in slower economic growth for years to come. We may well experience several years of a bad economy, as occurred, for example, after the profligate mortgage lending booms in both Sweden and Mexico in the early 1990s. There could even be another “lost decade,” like that suffered by Mexico in the 1980s after its spending spree during the oil price boom, or by Japan in the 1990s after the bursting of the bubble in its housing market in the 1980s.\n",
    "In this book I argue that the housing bubble that created the subprime crisis ultimately grew as big as it did because we as a society do not understand, or know how\n",
    "10\n",
    "\n",
    "to deal with, speculative bubbles. Even intelligent, well-informed people—who certainly knew that there had been bubbles throughout history and could even recite examples— typically did not fully comprehend what was happening in the run-up to the subprime crisis. Business and government leaders did not know how to deal with this situation, nor did they establish the kinds of new financial institutions that could have managed it.\n",
    "The view that the ultimate cause of the global financial crisis is the psychology of the real estate bubble (with contributions from the stock market bubble before that) has certainly been expressed before. But it would appear that most people have not taken this view to heart, and at the very least that they do not appreciate all of its ramifications. Accounts of the crisis often seem instead to place the ultimate blame entirely on such factors as growing dishonesty among mortgage lenders; increasing greed among securitizers, hedge funds, and rating agencies; or the mistakes of former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.\n",
    "It is time to recognize what has been happening and to take fundamental steps to restructure the institutional foundations of the housing and financial economy. This means taking both short-run steps to alleviate the crisis and making longer-term changes that will inhibit the development of bubbles, stabilize the housing and larger financial markets, and provide greater financial security to households and businesses, all the while allowing new ideas to drive financial innovation.\n",

    "## BitCoin meets Google Trends and Wikipedia: Quantifying the relationship between phenomena of the Internet era\n",
    "Ladislav Kristoufek, 2013\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital currencies have emerged as a new fascinating phenomenon in the financial markets. Recent events on the most popular of the digital currencies – BitCoin – have risen crucial questions about behavior of its exchange rates and they offer a field to study dynamics of the market which consists practically only of speculative traders with no fundamentalists as there is no fundamental value to the currency. In the paper, we connect two phenomena of the latest years – digital currencies, namely BitCoin, and search queries on Google Trends and Wikipedia – and study their relationship. We show that not only are the search queries and the prices connected but there also exists a pronounced asymmetry between the effect of an increased interest in the currency while being above or below its trend value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction of the Internet has completely changed the way real economy works. By enabling practically all Internet users to interact at once and to exchange and share information almost cost-free, more efficient decisions on the markets are possible. Even though the interconnection between digital and real economies has hit several bumps such as the DotCom Bubble of the break of the millennium, the benefits are believed to have overcome the costs.\n",
    "One of the fascinating phenomena of the Internet era is an emergence of digital currencies such as BitCoin, LiteCoin, NameCoin, PPCoin, Ripple and Ven to name the most popular ones. A digital currency can be defined as an alternative currency which is exclusively electronic and thus has no physical form. It is also not issued by any specific central bank or government of a specific country and it is thus practically detached from the real economy. Note that a digital and a virtual currency are not synonymous since the virtual currencies are trading currencies in virtual worlds (most frequently in the massive multiplayer online games – MMOGs – such as World of Warcraft or Second Life). Even though the digital currencies are almost isolated from the real economies, their prices (exchange rates) have experienced quite an erratic behavior in the recent months. Specifically, the BitCoin currency – the most popular of the digital currencies – started the year of 2013 at levels of $13 per a BitCoin and rocketed to $230 on 9 April 2013 potentially creating an absurd profit of almost 1700% in less than four months. Later the same year, the price soared even higher to $395 on 9 November 2013, which accounts for a profit of approximately 2900% since the beginning of 2013.\n",
    "Such behavior cannot be explained by standard economic and financial theories – e.g. future cash-flows model1, purchasing power parity2,3 and uncovered interest rate parity4,5 – in a satisfactory manner. In general, currencies can be seen as standard economic goods which are priced by interaction of supply and demand on the market. These are driven by macroeconomic variables of an issuing country or institution (or entity in general) such as GDP, interest rates, inflation, unemployment, and others. As there are no macroeconomic fundamentals for the digital currencies, the supply function is either fixed (if the currency amount is fixed) or it evolves according to some publicly known algorithm, which is the case of the BitCoin market. The demand side of the market is not driven by an expected macroeconomic development of the underlying economy (as there is none) but it is driven only by expected profits of holding the currency and selling it later (as there are no profits from simply holding the currency due to no interest rates of the digital currencies). The market is thus dominated by short-term investors, trend chasers, noise traders and speculators. The fundamentalist segment of the market is completely missing due to the fact that there are no fundamentals allowing for setting of a ‘‘fair’’ price. The digital currency price is thus driven solely by the investors’ faith in the perpetual growth. Investors’ sentiment then becomes a crucial variable. However, it is not a trivial task to find a good measure or proxy of investors’ sentiment in this matter. Quite recently, search queries provided by Google Trends and Wikipedia have proved to be a useful source of information in financial applications ranging from the home bias and the traded volume explanations through the earnings announcements to the portfolio diversification and trading strat- egies6–12. The frequency of searches of terms related to the digital currency can be a good measure of interest in the currency and it can have a good explanatory power.\n",
    "Here, we study the relationship between prices of the BitCoin currency (for a detailed description of a functioning of the currency, refer to Ref. 13) and related searched terms on Google Trends and Wikipedia. We find a striking positive correlation between a price level of BitCoin and the searched terms as well as a dynamic rela- tionship which is bidirectional. Moreover, we uncover an asymmetry between effects of search queries related to prices above and below a short-term trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "Digital currencies are new economic instruments with special attri- butes. Probably the most important one of them is the fact that they have no underlying asset, they are not issued by any government or central bank and they bring no interest or dividends. Despite these facts, these currencies, and namely the BitCoin currency, have attracted the public attention due to the unprecedented price surges with possible profits of hundreds percent in just several weeks or months. In this paper, we analyzed the dynamic relationship between the BitCoin price and the interest in the currency measured by search queries on Google Trends and frequency of visits on the Wikipedia page on BitCoin. Apart from a very strong correlation between price level of the digital currency and both the Internet engines, we also find a strong causal relationships between the prices and searched terms. Importantly, we find that this relationship is bidirectional, i.e. not only do the search queries influence the prices but also the prices influence the search queries. This is well in hand with the expecta- tions about a financial asset with no underlying fundamentals. Speculation and trend chasing evidently dominate the BitCoin price dynamics.\n",
    "Specifically, we find that while the prices are high (above trend), the increasing interest pushes the prices further atop. From the opposite side, if the prices are below their trend, the growing interest pushes the prices even deeper. This forms an environment suitable for a quite frequent emergence of a bubble behavior which indeed has been observed for the BitCoin currency. We believe that the paper will serve as a starting point of the research line dealing with statist- ical properties, dynamics and bubble-burst behavior of the digital currencies as these provide a unique environment for studying a purely speculative financial market.\n",

    "## The Economics of Cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin and Beyond\n",
    "Jonathan Chiu, Thorsten V. Koeppl, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How well can a cryptocurrency serve as a means of payment? We study the optimal design of cryptocurrencies and assess quantitatively how well such currencies can support bilateral trade. The challenge for cryptocurrencies is to overcome double-spending by relying on competition to update the blockchain (costly mining) and by delaying settlement. We estimate that the current Bitcoin scheme generates a large welfare loss of 1.4% of consumption. This welfare loss can be lowered substantially to 0.08% by adopting an optimal design that reduces mining and relies exclusively on money growth rather than transaction fees to finance mining rewards. We also point out that cryptocurrencies can potentially challenge retail payment systems provided scaling limitations can be addressed.\n",

    "How well can a cryptocurrency serve as a means of payment? Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, many critics have denounced cryptocurrencies as fraud or outright bubbles. More nuanced opinions have argued that such currencies are only there to support payments for illegal activities or simply waste resources. Advocates point out, however, that – based on cryptographic principles to ensure security – these new currencies can support payments without the need to designate a third-party that controls the currency or payment instrument possibly for its own profit.1\n",
    "We take up this discussion and develop a general equilibrium model of a cryptocurrency that uses a blockchain as a record-keeping device for payments. Although Bitcoin in its current form has immense welfare costs, an optimally designed cryptocurrency can potentially support payments rather well. First, using Bitcoin transactions data, we show that the welfare cost of a cryptocurrency can be comparable to a cash system with moderate inflation. Second, using summary statistics for US debit card transactions, we find that a cryptocurrency can perform nearly as well as a low-value, retail payment system operating with very low fees.2\n",
    "Economics research so far has provided little insight into the economic relevance of cryptocurrencies. Most existing models of cryptocurrencies are built by computer scientists who mainly focus on the feasibility and security of these systems. Crucial issues such as the incentives of participants to cheat and the endogenous nature of some key variables such as the real value of a cryptocurrency in exchange have been largely ignored. Such considerations, however, are pivotal for understanding the optimal design and, hence, the economic value of cryptocurrency as a means of payment.\n",
    "Our focus is primarily on understanding how the design of a cryptocurrency influences the inter- actions among participants and their incentives to cheat. These incentives arise from a so-called “double-spending” problem. Cryptocurrencies are based on digitial records and, thus, can be copied easily and costlessly which means that they can potentially be used several times in transactions (for a more detailed description see Section 2 below). We formalize this double-spending problem and show how this problem is being addressed by (i) a resource-intensive competition for updating the records of transaction – a process commonly referred to as mining – and (ii) by introducing con- firmation lags for settling transactions in cryptocurrency. This implies that a cryptocurrency faces a trade-off between how fast transactions settle and a guarantee (or “finality”) for their settlement. Consequently, crytocurrencies cannot achieve immediate and final settlement of transactions.\n",
    "A strength of our analysis is that we take into account the costs of operating a cryptocurrency that prohibits double-spending. This allows us to quantitatively assess how efficient Bitcoin as a medium of exchange can be relative to existing means of payment. Calibrating our model to Bitcoin data, we find that from a social welfare perspective using Bitcoin is close to 500 times more costly than using traditional currency in a low inflation environment.\n",
    "This is, however, a result of the inefficient design of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin uses both currency growth and transaction fees to generate rewards for mining. In its current form, the cryptocurrency reward structure is too generous so that too many resources are being used to rule out double-spending and making it a secure form of payment. We show that the optimal way of providing rewards for mining is exclusively via currency creation at a very low rate rather than by using transaction fees. The optimal design of Bitcoin would generate a welfare cost of only about 0.08% of consumption which is equivalent to a cash system with moderate inflation.\n",
    "We also evaluate the efficiency of using a cryptocurrency system to support large-value and retail transactions. Using summary data for Fedwire and US Debit cards, we confirm that cryptocur- rencies are a much better alternative for low value, high-volume transactions than for large value payments. This is intuitive, as double spending incentives increase with the size of transactions. Hence, more mining and longer confirmation lags (which are both costly) are required when sup- porting large-value payments in a cryptocurrency. Our exercise shows that cryptocurrency systems can potentially be a valid alternative to retail payment systems that operate at very low fees, as soon as limits on the scale of such systems can be resolved.\n",
    "The economic literature on cryptocurrencies is very thin. We are not aware of any work that has formalized the design features of a cryptocurrency and that has studied its optimal design under the threat of double spending attacks. We model bilateral exchange based on money, we follow the recently promoted framework of Lagos and Wright (2005) and enrich it by modelling a mining competition to update the blockchain. For formalizing the blockchain itself, we rely on the theoretical literature of payment systems as a record-keeping device.3\n",
    "Our work is thus a first attempt to explicitly model the distinctive technological features of a cryptocurrency system which are a blockchain, mining and double-spending incentives within a quantitative economic model. We are also first to theoretically analyze the optimal design of a cryptocurrency and giving a quantitative answer to the efficiency properties of cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "Some recent contribution have analyzed – from a qualitative perspective – whether Bitcoin can function as a real currency given its security features and lack of usage for making frequent payments (see for example Yermack (2013) and B ̈ohme et al. (2015)). One question in this line of research is to empirically explain the valuation of cryptocurrencies. Gandal and Halaburda (2014) look at network effects associated with cryptocurrencies and investigate how such effects are reflected in their relative valuation. Glaser et al. (2014) look at how media coverage of Bitcoin drives part of the volatility in its valuation.4\n",
    "Another area of research investigates how digital currencies can influence the way monetary policy is conducted. But none of this work can be applied to cryptocurrencies that are based on a blockchain and operate without a designated third-party to issue the currency. Agarwal and Kimball (2015) advocate here that the adoption of digital currencies can facilitate the implementation of a negative interest rate policy, while Rogoff (2016) suggests that phasing out paper currency can undercut undesirable tax evasion and criminal activities. Our findings complements this work as we establish some potential bounds on the costs that can be levied on people through central bank issued digitalcurrency.5 Finally,Fern ́andez-VillaverdeandSanches(2016)modelcryptocurrenciesas privately issued fiat currencies and analyze – in the tradition of the literature on the free banking era – whether competition among different currencies can achieve price stability and efficiency of exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed record-keeping with a blockchain based on consensus through PoW is an intriguing concept. The economics of this technology that underlies most cryptocurrencies are driven by the individual incentives to double-spend and the costs associated with reining in these incentives. These costs are private in the form of settlement delay and social in the form of mining which is a public good. Consequently, as the scale of a cryptocurrency increases, it becomes more efficient. This explains why a double-spending proof equilibrium exists only when the user pool is sufficiently large, and why a cryptocurrency works best when the volume of transactions is large relative to the individual transaction size. This insight seems to be very much ignored in the current debate, but puts scalability of cryptocurrencies front and centre as the main technological challenge to be overcome. Our exercise shows that cryptocurrency systems can potentially be a viable alternative to retail payment systems, as soon as some technological limits can be resolved. For Bitcoin we find that it is not only extremely expensive in terms of its mining costs, but also inefficient in its long-run design. However, the efficiency of the Bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees. Another poten- tial improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether. In the Appendix, we explore the possibility of replacing PoW by a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. Our analysis finds conditions under which PoS can strictly dominate PoW and even sup- port immediate and final settlement. Notwithstanding, as we point out in this Appendix as well, many fundamental issues of a PoS protocol remain still to be sorted out. There remains much to be learned about the economic potential and the efficient, economic design of blockchain technology.\n",

    "## The macroeconomics of central bank issued digital currencies\n",
    "John Barrdear and Michael Kumhof, 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "We study the macroeconomic consequences of issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC) — a universally accessible and interest-bearing central bank liability, implemented via distributed ledgers, that competes with bank deposits as medium of exchange. In a DSGE model calibrated to match the pre-crisis United States, we find that CBDC issuance of 30% of GDP, against government bonds, could permanently raise GDP by as much as 3%, due to reductions in real interest rates, distortionary taxes, and monetary transaction costs. Countercyclical CBDC price or quantity rules, as a second monetary policy instrument, could substantially improve the central bank’s ability to stabilise the business cycle.\n",

    "Key words: Distributed ledgers, blockchain, banks, financial intermediation, bank lending, money creation, money demand, endogenous money, countercyclical policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper studies the macroeconomic consequences of a central bank granting universal, electronic, 24x7, national-currency-denominated and interest-bearing access to its balance sheet via the issuance, according to well-specified policy rules, of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). To study this issue we use a monetary-financial DSGE model, calibrated to match the United States in the pre-crisis period, that models CBDC as an imperfect substitute for bank deposits in the provision of monetary transaction services, and that models bank deposits as being created through loans or asset purchases as in Jakab and Kumhof (2015).\n",
    "A monetary regime with CBDC has never existed anywhere, a major reason being that the technology to make it feasible and resilient has until now not been available. There is therefore very little historical or empirical material that could help us to understand the costs and benefits of transitioning to such a regime, or to evaluate the different ways in which monetary policy could be conducted under it. We therefore choose the alternative approach of using a theoretical model as a laboratory where we can systematically study these issues. The model we present is detailed rather than stylised, both in order to make the exercise credible for policymakers and in order to avoid prejudging what are the most important economic mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of CBDC. Nevertheless, the modifications needed to introduce CBDC into this model are kept to a minimum in order to understand the key transmission channels more clearly. We have made considerable progress using this strategy, but much more work needs to be done.\n",
    "As a baseline, we consider a setting in which an initial stock of CBDC equal to 30% of GDP is issued against an equal amount of government debt, and is then, subject to countercyclical variations over the business cycle, maintained at that level. We choose 30% because this is an amount loosely similar to the magnitudes of QE conducted by various central banks over the last decade. We do not examine the question of the optimal steady-state stock of CBDC, but we note that it ought to be large enough to avoid problems with a “quantity zero lower bound” in the conduct of countercyclical policies.\n",
    "Our simulations suggest that this policy has a number of beneficial effects. First, it leads to an increase in the steady-state level of GDP of almost 3%, due to reductions in real interest rates, in distortionary tax rates, and in monetary transaction costs that are analogous to distortionary tax rates. Second, a CBDC regime can contribute to the stabilisation of the business cycle, by giving policymakers access to a second policy instrument that controls either the quantity or the price of CBDC in a countercyclical fashion. This second policy instrument becomes especially effective in response to shocks to private money demand and private money creation, and if the substitutability between CBDC balances and bank deposits in the production of monetary transaction services is low. Financial stability considerations also generally favour the issuance of CBDC, provided that the issuance mechanism ensures that CBDC is only issued or withdrawn against government debt. On the negative side, there remains a clear concern with the proper management of the risks involved in transitioning to a different monetary and financial regime.1\n",
    "Our work is motivated by the recent emergence of private digital currencies that offer participants access to both an alternative unit of account that is governed by predetermined money supply rules, and to a new payment system that is claimed to be superior to that offered by existing banking systems. Bitcoin was the first such system, being launched in January 2009 following the earlier release of a white paper describing its operation (Nakamoto (2008)).2 A substantial number of alternatives have since been developed,3 but at present Bitcoin remains the largest such system in operation.\n",
    "The monetary aspects of private digital currencies — a competing currency with an exogenous, predetermined money supply — are commonly held to be undesirable from the perspective of policymakers, but the innovation embodied in the payment systems of such schemes is held of some interest. It is important to stress that these two aspects of private digital currencies are logically distinct: it would be technically possible to implement a distributed payment system in the style of Bitcoin that nevertheless remained denominated in a traditional currency. The question that naturally emerges is whether it might be socially beneficial to do so,4 and it is towards this question that our paper is addressed.\n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, the only other theoretical work on the subject of private digital currencies is that of Fernández-Villaverde and Sanches (2016), who explore the conditions under which multiple units of account could exist in stable currency competition, by extending the model of Lagos and Wright (2003). They demonstrate the possibility of the value of privately-issued currencies being constant over time, but show that, absent productive capital, an efficient allocation as the unique global equilibrium requires driving private money out of the economy. However, the presence of productive capital reverses this result, so that equilibria that feature the value of private money converging to zero are ruled out. In our model, we abstract from all considerations of currency competition, instead supposing an economy with a single, government-defined unit of account. Privately-created money does exist in our model, but only in the form of bank deposits that maintain a 1-to-1 exchange rate with government money.\n",
    "The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II gives a brief overview of digital currencies and the distributed ledgers that underlie them. Section III provides a general and non-technical overview of the pros and cons of CBDC. Section IV contains a detailed presentation of the theoretical model. Section V discusses the calibration of this model. Section VI presents simulation results, and discusses policy lessons. Section VII concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both central banks and private financial institutions are paying increasing attention to the emergence of digital currencies and the distributed ledgers on which they are based, as this technology may present an opportunity to improve the efficiency, resiliency and accessibility of systems that facilitate monetary and financial transactions. There are, however, serious problems with existing private versions of such currencies. These problems are not associated with the viability of distributed ledgers in general, but rather with their prohibitively high costs of transaction verification. Alternative implementations, such as “permissioned” systems, may potentially avoid these costs by stepping away from purely decentralised designs while still retaining many of the benefits. One possible application of such a permissioned system would be the issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) — universal, electronic, 24x7, national-currency-denominated and interest-bearing access to a central bank’s balance sheet.\n",
    "Any attempt to study the macroeconomic consequences of adopting a CBDC regime faces the problem that there is no historical experience to draw on, and thus also a complete absence of data for empirical work. Our approach has therefore instead relied on using a monetary-financial DSGE model, calibrated to match the US economy in the pre-crisis period, and extended to add features related to CBDC, as a laboratory that allows us to study the issues that are most relevant for policy, including the efficiency gains and stabilisation effects of CBDC. The model also clarifies the open empirical questions that need to be answered to make quantitative estimates of the effects of CBDC more reliable.\n",
    "Our model should be familiar to central bankers and academics, because it starts from a canonical New Keynesian monetary model with nominal and real frictions. There are however two departures from the standard model.\n",
    "The first is that it incorporates the financing through money creation (FMC) banking model of Jakab and Kumhof (2015), where monetary bank deposits are created by the extension of loans. A realistic model of banks is essential for the exercise performed in this paper, because of the key role of banks as providers of the monetary transaction medium that would compete with CBDC in the real world. A critical ingredient in the FMC framework is the existence of private-sector demand functions for monetary transactions balances, with the supply of monetary transactions balances prior to the introduction of CBDC, in the form of bank deposits, determined by commercial banks. These demand functions for monetary transaction balances can ignore central bank money other than CBDC because, during normal economic times, central bank reserves are endogenous and are, in any event, not held by the non-bank private sector, and because cash is a very small and non-constitutive part of the financial system.\n",
    "The second departure from the standard model is the incorporation of the minimal structure necessary to accommodate interest-bearing CBDC into our model. This amounts to the reintroduction of central bank-issued money into the money demand function, but with the difference that this money can (unlike reserves) be held by the non-bank private sector, that it is (unlike cash) interest-bearing, and that it competes with endogenously created private bank-issued money. Many critical questions concerning CBDC are therefore related to the functional form and calibration of the joint demand function for CBDC and bank deposits.\n",
    "Using this model, we find that a system of CBDC offers a number of clear macroeconomic advantages, with few obvious large costs. The advantages that we identify in this paper include large steady state output gains of almost 3% for an injection of CBDC equal to 30% of GDP, and sizeable gains in the effectiveness of systematic or discretionary countercyclical monetary policy, particularly if a sizeable share of shocks is to private credit creation or to the demand for monetary transaction balances, and if the substitutability between CBDC and bank deposits in transaction technologies is low. Our analysis suggests that the only conditions needed to secure these gains are that a sufficiently large stock of CBDC is issued in steady state, and that the issuance mechanism for CBDC ensures that the central bank only trades CBDC against government debt instruments.\n",
    "In addition to these results, we also find that the theoretical and empirical gaps in our knowledge concerning CBDC have become much clearer. We are hopeful that filling these gaps will form part of a multi-pronged research agenda across central banks, covering economic theory, empirical work, and a research program on the technological aspects of distributed ledgers that are relevant to CBDC.\n",
    "Important theoretical questions include the following: What are the welfare properties of alternative CBDC policy rules, including their interaction with traditional monetary policy rules, with macroprudential policy rules, and with fiscal policy rules? Should CBDC policy rules also react to financial variables, rather than simply to inflation as in this paper? What are the advantages and disadvantages of introducing CBDC into the economy through spending (on goods/services and/or transfers), lending (directly or via the banking system), or the purchase of financial assets, including not only government bonds but also other financial assets? Which of these would best safeguard financial stability? How might the issuance of CBDC interact with the unwinding of Quantitative Easing? What could be the impact of CBDC on international liquidity and exchange rate dynamics? How might the introduction of CBDC affect the likelihood of a bank run when bank deposits carry default risk, or the dynamics of a run if one were to occur?\n",
    "In order to more reliably answer many of these questions, we need better answers to four empirical questions. We use the remainder of the conclusions to summarise these.\n",
    "The first empirical question concerns the appropriate calibration of the main sources of demand for bank liabilities. In our model, we split the overall demand into demands related to the scale variables consumption, investment, working capital and asset holdings. The question is whether data on different holders of bank liabilities could allow us to better identify the relative sizes of these different demands.\n",
    "The second empirical question concerns the interest semi-elasticity of the demand for bank deposits. Estimates for this have been produced in the past, but most often for narrower monetary aggregates rather than for the very broad aggregates that are relevant for CBDC according to our model. The model also suggests that it is important to know how this elasticity varies over different holders of bank deposits. These questions could be answered using currently available data and techniques. The third empirical question concerns the interest semi-elasticity of the demand for CBDC relative to bank deposits, and therefore, by implication, the elasticity of substitution between CBDC and bank deposits in household and firm portfolios of monetary transaction balances. Our discussion in Section V.C alluded to how one might attempt to answer this question.\n",
    "The fourth empirical question concerns the appropriate calibration of the steady state spread between the interest rate paid on CBDC and that paid on bank deposits. This spread, which currently does not exist and therefore cannot be quantified using historical data, will be influenced by many different factors, including differences in perceived risk relative to bank deposits, differences in the convenience of use, and differences in operating costs due to differences in underlying technologies.\n",
    "All of the foregoing represents essential building blocks in a research agenda that puts monetary quantity aggregates, and therefore financial sector balance sheets, back at the centre of macroeconomic analysis, with obvious relevance also to financial stability issues. We are hopeful that there will be a broad collaborative effort to study these questions.\n",

    "## The New Financial Order, risk in the 21st century\n",
    "Robert Shiller\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic gains achieved through technological progress do not them- selves guarantee that more people will lead good lives. Just as enor- mous economic insecurity and income inequality pervade the world to- day, worsening conditions can develop even as technological advances mark greater levels of economic achievement. But new risk manage- ment ideas can enable us to manage a vast array of risks—those present and future, near and far—and to limit the downside effects of capital- ism’s “creative destruction.” Application of these ideas will not only help reduce downside risks, but it will also permit more positive risk- taking behavior, thereby engendering a more varied and ultimately more inspiring world.\n",
    "The New Financial Order proposes a radically new risk management infrastructure to help secure the wealth of nations: to preserve the bil- lions of minor—and not so minor—economic gains that sustain people around the world. Most of these gains seldom make the news or even evoke much public discussion, but they can enrich hard-won economic security and without them any semblance of progress is lost. By radi- cally changing our basic institutions and approach to management of all these risks both large and small we can do far more to improve our lives and our society than through piecemeal tinkering.\n",
    "Just as modern systems of insurance protect people against cata- strophic risks in their lives, this new infrastructure would utilize fi- nancial inventions that protect people against systemic risks: from job loss because of changing technologies to threats to home and com- munity because of changing economic conditions.\n",
    "If successfully implemented, this newly proposed financial infra- structure would enable people to pursue their dreams with greater con- fidence than they can under existing modes of risk management. With- out such a means to greater security, it will be difficult for young people, whose ideas and skills represent the raw materials for a growth- oriented information society, to take the risks necessary to convert their intellectual energies into useful goods and services for society.\n",
    "Historically, economic thinkers have been limited by the state of rel- evant risk management principles of their day. Recent advances in finan-cial theory, information technology, and the science of psychology al- low us to design new inventions for managing the technological and economic risks inherent in capitalism—inventions that could not have been envisioned by past thinkers. Karl Marx, the instigator of the com- munist movement, had no command of such risk management ideas when he published Das Kapital in 1867. Nor did John Maynard Keynes, the principal expositor of modern liberal economic policy, when he published the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. Nor did Milton Friedman, the chief expositor of economic liber- tarianism, when he published Capitalism and Freedom in 1962.\n",
    "Ultimately, The New Financial Order is about applying risk man- agement technology to the major problems of our lives. That is, it de- picts an electronically integrated risk management culture designed to work in tandem with the already existing economic institutions of cap- italism to promote wealth. The book does not promise utopia, nor is it a solution to all of our problems. It is not motivated by any political ideology, nor by sympathies with one or another social class. It does of- fer steps we can realistically take to make our lives much better. By pre- senting new ideas about basic risk management technology, this book does not propose a finished blueprint for the future. Instead, it de- scribes a new direction that will inevitably be improved by future ex- perimentation, innovation, and new advances in financial theory, in the manipulation of relevant risk-related information, and in the ability of social scientists to draw on psychology to design user-friendly tech- niques to help people manage income-related risks.\n",
    "I began working on this book in 1997 as a culmination of years of think- ing and writing about how to improve institutions for dealing with risks, both to individuals and to society. In 1993 I published a technical monograph, Macro Markets: Creating Institutions for Managing Soci- ety’s Largest Economic Risks, accompanied by a series of scholarly arti- cles on the general topic of risk management with Allan Weiss, Karl Case, Stefano Athanasoulis, and others. But these pieces neither drew the big picture nor addressed the big issues that I thought needed to be stressed to a broad audience.\n",
    "At that time I had planned to use this book to integrate my think- ing about risk management into a broader picture of our society and economy. I had hoped to correct the egregious public misunderstand- ing of technological and economic risks, and convey a clearer, more ac-curate picture of the actual risks people face. Also, I had hoped to ex- plain how the presence of various forms of risk, many hidden in plain sight, prevent us from achieving our highest potential.\n",
    "But I was interrupted in 1999 by the increasingly impressive evidence of an enormous boom in the stock market, a boom that proved of his- toric proportions. On the advice of my fellow economist and life-long friend Jeremy Siegel, I decided to set aside the work on this book to write a book about the stock market boom—a classic example of the very kind of misperception and mismanagement of long-term risks that I had written about in the scholarly literature. With the help of Prince- ton University Press, I managed to get Irrational Exuberance into bookstores in mid-March 2000, precisely at the peak of the market and of the tech bubble.\n",
    "Irrational Exuberance concluded by saying that not only was the level of the stock market exaggerated but society’s attention to the stock market, and the importance we attach to it, were also exagger- ated. The stock market will not make us all rich, nor will it solve our economic problems. It is foolhardy for citizens to pay attention to the world of business only for the purpose of picking stocks, and even more foolhardy to think stock prices will go nowhere but up.\n",
    "The New Financial Order picks up where my earlier research and Irrational Exuberance together leave off. By showing how we mis- construe risk and by bringing significant new ideas to bear on this prob- lem, I hope to explain how we can fundamentally resolve the economic risk predicament. We are indeed entering a new economic era, robust stock market or not, and we need to think about the implications of emerging technologies—the real drivers of global economic change— not just on individual companies and their stock prices but on all of us. We need to understand how the technology of the past has shaped our institutions. And we need to change our thinking in a vigorous, cre- ative way to navigate this new environment. The New Financial Order outlines critical means of making this ideal a reality.\n",
    "As an aid to critical readers of this book, I have also assembled a number of technical and background papers as well as news clips re- lating to the themes of this book. They are on the web site http:/www. newfinancialorder.com.\n",

    "A Model of Radical Financial Innovation\n",
    "IT REMAINS NOW to pull various ideas together into a model of really significant financial innovation, not just incremental innovation that has no larger direction or strategy, but innovation that can be transforming to our lives. We have already seen most of the basic ele- ments of a model of radical financial innovation, with the various ideas for risk management institutions, the GRIDs and indexed units of ac- count, the directions for research on risks and of advocacy for change. And we have seen some concrete illustrations of these principles in ex- amples from history. But we need to distill from the analysis in this book several additional principles of innovation in economic risk man- agement that have driven our success in the past.\n",
    "Risk Manifestation\n",
    "Perhaps the biggest obstacle to effective risk management is psycho- logical. The public does not see its biggest risks and tends to focus more often on inconsequential risks that seem to them more salient. It is not enough for researchers and analysts to identify major risks statis- tically. If people at large do not appreciate their risks, they will neither take steps to deal with them nor give full support to institutions that deal with them.\n",
    "This was the problem that hampered the advocates of life insurance, social security, and unemployment insurance: The public was not in- terested in managing these risks. But, eventually, the public was per- suaded to take some important risk management steps. The process by which the first national disability insurance, health insurance, and so- cial security were invented in Germany in the 1880s was one of intense public discussion. This led to a public understanding of the risks and helped people understand that purely random outcomes affect our eco-\n",

    "nomic well-being in important ways. The period of the Great Depres- sion, a time of great public discussion of risk issues in the United States, also led to many personal risk management innovations. The Depres- sion was so dramatic and sudden an event that it made the economic risks we face obvious to everyone. Today’s leaders need to start talking about these risks, to make them apparent before another such eco- nomic disaster occurs.\n",
    "Persuading the public of the other, bigger, long-term economic risks that remain unmanaged today will take some work. There seems to be hardly any public recognition of the risk of a major change in the eco- nomic status of nations, or of the possibility that the economic in- equality within a nation could get much worse. There seems to be an almost exclusive focus among business commentators on predicting whether the business situation will improve in the next six months to a year, as if this were our only concern. Public leaders must be willing to talk about longer-term risks that we all face. This does not mean that they should be negative and pessimistic, only that they should address the long-term uncertainties that really matter, and do so within the context of risk management devices that can be realistically imple- mented—thus helping to alleviate such risk.\n",
    "Creating the macro markets, markets for long-term claims on in- come flows or on illiquid assets such as our homes, would serve to make risks more palpable because they would allow us to see the day- to-day, even minute-by-minute, changes in fundamental economic val- ues that are invisible today. When people see the price of a claim on the GDP of their nation or of a claim on their occupational income fluctu- ate substantially, they will see the risks much more vividly.\n",
    "Proper design of the GRIDs, so that they are used well by individu- als for detailed information risks, can also help with risk manifestation. The presence of detailed public data on individual livelihoods, finely disaggregated, will undoubtedly bring to the fore much more public discussion of risks than are seen today.\n",
    "Finally, risk manifestation can be the subject of marketing campaigns by individual businesses once they have major new risk management products to sell. Life insurance companies have made hugely successful businesses doing this, reminding people of the uncertainty of the time of their own deaths. The time will be ripe for an industry of even big- ger proportions that reminds people of their biggest economic risks and offers at the same time the means to deal with those risks.\n",

    "Robust Psychological Framing\n",
    "The importance of psychological framing is an essential lesson of this book. The names we use, the categories we delineate, the institutional arrangements we assign to these categories, all matter greatly for the success of our risk management institutions. Sound frames must be built from the beginning so that they make sense as long-term risk management vehicles.\n",
    "Financial innovators, to be really effective, need to think about what kind of reframing of our basic standards and institutions they should encourage, so that their innovations can have their full potential. In- novators need to get past the mindset of incremental thinking, creat- ing only small improvements in products that will immediately succeed in the current environment. They must try to think of major changes that are currently outside consumers’ habitual frame of reference, plan- ning a new psychological framing, and having the patience to promote the new ideas for a long time, until they take hold in public thinking.\n",
    "Planning for society’s risks must take account of the fact that, as we have seen, it is possible to foster an enduring personal sense of commit- ment and obligation to others. If an individual perceives a commitment as having been freely chosen, the fulfillment of this personal commit- ment becomes tied to that individual’s sense of identity and self-esteem. Long-term public acceptance of risk management contracts can be en- hanced if they are properly framed as enlightened actions that individu- als undertake, acting freely and reflecting a common consensus, a con- sensus arrived at before the risk’s outcomes are known. This aspect of framing would play a fundamental role in creating inequality insurance as well as establishing intergenerational social security, and would en- hance the viability of other risk management ideas discussed here. These institutions require a sense of public commitment to a standard of risk sharing that must remain unchanged through time.\n",
    "This kind of robust psychological framing has been achieved suc- cessfully in the past. Calling the original disability, health, and social se- curity systems insurance in the 1880s in Germany created a sense of le- gitimacy to the institution. Calling the amounts paid in to the U.S. social security system contributions rather than taxes ensured the legit- imacy of claims of eventual return on these payments. Renaming the negative income tax the earned income tax credit helped ensure public acceptance.\n",
    "radical financial innovation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But robust psychological framing means not only choosing the right names for our institutions. It also means creating sensible designs for these institutions that can stand the test of time so that the original framing is reinforced by good sense that survives long-term changes in society. This is why intergenerational social security must be designed as a device that effectively balances the real and fundamental risks of generations. This is why international risk management contracts must be arranged between nations that really do face different risks, and with a sensible schedule of contingent payments that makes long-term good sense.\n",
    "This design imperative requires, for instance, that in inequality in- surance we replace our arbitrary standards for progressive income tax- ation with a method of defining progressive income tax rates that con- trols the distribution of income. By attaching this fundamental concept to the name inequality insurance, which makes its risk management function manifest, by making it part of a solemn social compact, soci- ety can control the risk that our income distribution may widen sharply in the future.\n",
    "If a new financial order is to be truly effective, it has to employ proper psychological framing to ensure that it addresses the funda- mental economic risks that we want to avoid, encoded comprehen- sively enough that it affects the bottom line of people’s welfare, and de- fined sensibly enough that it cannot later be frustrated on the grounds that it was never based on solid principles.\n",
    "Fundamental Experimentation\n",
    "Despite all of our research, we will never know for sure how to design risk management devices on abstract principles alone. No one has a the- oretical model of risks and of moral hazard that is so well defined that we can know how to build devices to work perfectly the first time we try. Over the years, businesses have conducted experiments, and their observations of the outcome have led to their business models. The same process must take place with radical financial innovations that transform our economy. We must begin with various small experiments.\n",
    "People do not generally anticipate the full consequences of eco- nomic inventions. They do not and cannot know all the ramifications. But many countries, many local governments, many stock exchanges, many banks, and many insurance companies can all try somewhat dif-\n",

    "ferent experiments. We must make a priority experimentation with new financial ideas that might well result in fundamental changes that may eventually be copied all around the world. This means making experi- ments whose stated and explicit goal is to discover such fundamental changes. These must include many experiments whose probability of success is low.\n",
    "Government is fundamental in the area of experimentation with fi- nancial invention. Governments, for instance, can sponsor experimen- tation by offering research grants. For example, the negative income tax experiments in the 1970s led to fundamental changes in our tax code. Unfortunately, such experiments are not so common today, but government could spur experimentation by businesses by, for example, providing better resources for awarding financial patents so that the patent office can better evaluate the outcomes of experiments.\n",
    "Private initiative, too, spurs many of financial inventions, turning businesses into major laboratories for the kind of experimentation needed to create a new financial order. The finance community has been extraordinarily inventive and willing to experiment in the past; we have good reason to hope they can be so in the future.\n",
    "We must then continue studying examples of financial experimenta- tion. We must even look for inspiration to developing countries, for in- ventions there can be extended for application elsewhere and many de- veloping countries have more impetus to experiment. We learned of financial futures from Japan in the Tokugawa period. The Chinese spe- cial economic zones such as Shenzhen and the Russian free economic zones such as Kaliningrad might well provide experiments the likes of which the world may find valuable. We can also learn from countries that are in economic trouble since they are the most likely to experi- ment with new solutions to problems from high inflation to unstable exchange rates. We learned of indexation from countries undergoing uncontrolled high inflation and of indexed units of account from Chile during a difficult time in its history.\n",
    "Most financial experiments that offer the hope of producing radical innovation need to be long-run experiments, lasting not months but years. The Chilean UF took fifteen years to firmly establish itself among the public as a unit of account. When social security was invented in Germany, it took decades before the world was convinced of its im- portance. Changing public modes of thought is necessarily a slow process. An initial financial invention may require both supporting in-\n",

    "ventions for its full implementation and new ideas on how to market the invention to the public. These will not come along until many minds have had the opportunity to reflect at length on the potential of the invention by observing it in action.\n",
    "Activities and Opportunities\n",
    "Six fundamental risk management ideas along with related ideas for an economic infrastructure are offered in this book that would extend the realm of financial management from the financial capitals of the world to all of us, wherever we live and whatever our wealth and the nature of our risk. Each of these represents quite fundamental changes. It may seem quite remarkable that all of these ideas would be implemented. But we must start somewhere. If we can achieve but one of them, in some form, it would be a major improvement. And the ideas feed upon and support one another, so that implementing one makes it easier to implement another.\n",
    "In closing, we might reflect on the possible magnitude of the work needed to achieve the changes proposed here, if something like many of these proposals are really to be implemented. Democratizing finance means drastically expanding the financial sector so that it plays a deep role in our lives. Such an enterprise would generate whole new indus- tries and major tasks for people to complete.\n",
    "The advent of insurance for livelihoods and home values would re- quire a fundamental transformation of the insurance industry, a trans- formation to make it far more important to our lives than it is now. We would write policies on risks far greater than the risks, such as the risk of early death, that our insurance industry covers today.\n",
    "The advent of macro markets would require a fundamental trans- formation of our financial markets. Macro markets for single-family homes will mean liquid new international markets for assets that may be worth more than the world’s stock markets. Macro markets for GDPs will mean markets that trade claims on income that may be worth over ten or twenty times the value of the world’s stock markets. The presence of such markets, with their fundamental importance for the world economy, would represent a revolutionary expansion of the securities industry.\n",
    "The advent of income-linked loans would require a major change in the lending industry, which would become involved in fundamental\n",

    "\n",
    "risk management, allowing it to contribute to people’s lives by reduc- ing their risks of bankruptcy and hardship. The institutions for making loans to businesses and to governments would be fundamentally trans- formed as well.\n",
    "The advent of inequality insurance, intergenerational social security, and international agreements for risk control would bring finance prin- ciples into government policy in a way never seen before. This is not growth of the government sector, with the attendant moral hazard problems that it would entail, but the extension of governmental in- frastructure so that some of our most important uncertainties can be managed. The implementation of ideas like these may help prevent some kinds of disastrous economic consequences that our rapidly ex- panding technology might otherwise bring to certain economic groups or to certain countries in coming decades.\n",
    "Creating and managing the GRIDs is a task that would involve pri- vate companies as well as the government. We need to develop a broader industry of data supply, an industry of many firms supplying the GRIDs, an industry that covers the world, and that makes use of the best techniques to ensure individual privacy as well as the extensive public use of data pertaining to risks.\n",
    "Creating the new units of measurements, the indexed units of ac- count, is also a task both for private companies and for the government. The government would likely take the first steps, for instance by re- stating the tax system in terms of indexed units of account and estab- lishing the legal status of such units. But, once established, it would be expected that there would be many privately offered alternative units that would offer focused alternatives to the government units and that would allow the system to diversify through competition and thereby better represent actual human needs.\n",
    "The jobs that so many of us will have in making such a new financial order a reality are multitude, and yet well worth it. Changes as funda- mental and transforming as the new financial order will have to occupy a good deal of our time and energies in transition.\n",
    "Our methods of controlling our economic risks cannot remain where they are. The same breathtaking technology that generates new risks must be adapted to the purpose of managing these risks. Let us not take prosperity for granted. We must remember our economic vul- nerabilities in this time of technological change, and we must take ad- vantage of our new information capabilities to control these risks. We\n",

We should be willing to try risk man- agement ideas that seem—at first—unnatural, possibly even unwork- able. We should be ready to make risk management arrangements on a very large scale, aggressively pursuing the risks that have the potential for great damage.\n",

    "## Some stylized facts of the Bitcoin market\n",
    "Aurelio F. Bariviera c,∗, María José Basgall a,b, Waldo Hasperué b, Marcelo Naiouf b, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years a new type of tradable assets appeared, generically known as cryptocurrencies. Among them, the most widespread is Bitcoin. Given its novelty, this paper investigates some statistical properties of the Bitcoin market. This study compares Bitcoin and standard currencies dynamics and focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales. We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the traditional definition, a currency has three main properties: (i) it serves as a medium of exchange, (ii) it is used as a unit of account and (iii) it allows to store value. Along economic history, monies were related to political power. In the beginning, coins were minted in precious metals. Therefore, the value of a coin was intrinsically determined by the value of the metal itself. Later, money was printed in paper bank notes, but its value was linked somewhat to a quantity in gold, guarded in the vault of a central bank. Nation states have been using their political power to regulate the use of currencies and impose one currency (usually the one issued by the same nation state) as legal tender for obligations within their territory. In the twentieth century, a major change took place: abandoning gold standard. The detachment of the currencies (specially the US dollar) from the gold standard meant a recognition that the value of a currency (specially in a world of fractional banking) was not related to its content or representation in gold, but to a broader concept as the confidence in the economy in which such currency is based. In this moment, the value of a currency reflects the best judgment about the monetary policy and the ‘‘health’’ of its economy.\n",
    "In recent years, a new type of currencies, a synthetic one, emerged. We name this new type as ‘‘synthetic’’ because it is not the decision of a nation state, nor represents any underlying asset or tangible wealth source. It appears as a new tradable asset resulting from a private agreement and facilitated by the anonymity of internet. Among this synthetic currencies, Bitcoin (BTC) emerges as the most important one, with a market capitalization of 15 billions, as of December 2016. There are other cryptocurrencies, based on blockchain technology, such as Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP). The website https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ counts up to 641 of such monies. However, as we can observe in Fig. 1, Bitcoin represents 89% of the capitalization of the market of all cryptocurrencies. One open question today is if Bitcoin is in fact a, or may be considered as a, currency. Until now, we cannot observe that Bitcoin fulfills the main properties of a standard currency. It is barely accepted as a medium of exchange (e.g. to buy some products online), it is not used as unit of account (there are no financial statements valued in Bitcoins), and we can hardly believe that, given the great swings in price, anyone can consider Bitcoin as a suitable option to store value. Given these characteristics, Bitcoin could fit as an ideal asset for speculative purposes. There is no underlying asset to relate its value to and there is an open platform to operate round the clock.\n",
    "The aim of this paper is to study some statistical characteristics of Bitcoin et al.vis-à-vis some major currencies, during the period 2011–2017. We will focus our attention on the evolution of the long memory of the time series. This article contributes to the literature in three important aspects. First, we expand the empirical studies by analyzing the long memory of a new asset. Second, we compare the behavior of Bitcoin with some major currencies. Third, we highlight the evolution in the underlying dynamics of this new market. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the recent emerging literature on Bitcoin, Section 3 describes the methodology used in the paper, Section 4 presents the data and results of our empirical analysis and, finally Section 5 draws the main conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speculation has a long history and it seems inherent to capitalism. One common feature of speculative assets in history has been the difficulty in valuation. Tuplipmania, the South Sea bubble, and more others, reflect on one side human greedy behavior, and on the other side, the difficulty to set an objective value to an asset. All speculative behaviors were reflected in a super-exponential growth of the time series [2].\n",
    "Cryptocurrencies can be seen as the libertarian response to central bank failure to manage financial crises, as the one occurred in 2008. Also cryptocurrencies can bypass national restrictions to international transfers, probably at a cheaper cost. Bitcoin was created by a person or group of persons under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The description of Bitcoin Core, i.e. the open source client of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, is described in [3].\n",
    "The discussion of Bitcoin has several perspectives. The computer science perspective deals with the strengths and weaknesses of blockchain technology. In fact, according to [4], the introduction of a ‘‘distributed ledger’’ is the key innovation. Traditional means of payments (e.g. a credit card), rely on a central clearing house that validate operations, acting as ‘‘middleman’’ between buyer and seller. On contrary, the payment validation system of Bitcoin is decentralized. There is a growing army of miners, who put their computer power at disposal of the network, validating transactions by gathering together blocks, adding them to the ledger and forming a ‘block chain’. This work is remunerated by giving the miners Bitcoins, what makes (until now) the validating costs cheaper than in a centralized system. The validation is made by solving some kind of algorithm. With the time solving the algorithm becomes harder, since the whole ledger must be validated. Consequently it takes more time to solve it. Contrary to traditional currencies, the total number of Bitcoins to be issued is beforehand fixed: 21 million. In fact, the issuance rate of Bitcoins is expected to diminish over time. According to [5], validating the public ledger was initially rewarded with 50 Bitcoins, but the protocol foresee halving this quantity every four years. At the current pace, the maximum number of Bitcoins will be reached in 2140. Taking into account the decentralized character, Bitcoin transactions seem secure. All transactions are recorded in several computer servers around the world. In order to commit fraud, a person should change and validate (simultaneously) several ledgers, which is almost impossible. Additional, ledgers are public, with encrypted identities of parties, making transactions ‘‘pseudonymous, not anonymous’’ [6].\n",
    "The legal perspective of Bitcoin is fuzzy. Bitcoin is not issued, nor endorsed by a nation state. It is not an illegal substance. As such, its transaction is not regulated.\n",
    "The economic perspective is still under study. The use of Bitcoin in daily life is marginal. At the time of writing this paper, there were only 8367 retailers worldwide who accepted Bitcoins as a means of payment, mostly concentrated in North America, western Europe, and some major cities in South America and South East Asia [7]. There is not too much information regarding Bitcoin exchanges. This gray situation raises some concerns about a possible Ponzi scheme. There are no savings accounts in Bitcoins and consequently no interest rates. All these elements together contribute to its difficulty to assess a fair value. Cheung et al. [8] detect several price bubbles over the period 2010–2014. Three of them lasted from 66 to 106 days to burst. Ciaian and coworkers [9] find no macro-financial indications driving Bitcoin price, and they do not discard that investor speculation affects significantly the price evolution.\n",
    "2.2. The efficient market hypothesis\n",
    "As recalled in the previous section, the nature of the Bitcoin is not yet clear. In particular, given the nonexistence of saving accounts in Bitcoin, and consequently the absence of a Bitcoin interest rate, precludes the idea of studying the price behavior in relation with cash flows generated by Bitcoins. As a consequence, we aim to analyze the underlying dynamics of the price signal, using the Efficient Market Hypothesis as a theoretical framework. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is the cornerstone of financial economics. One of the seminal works on the stochastic dynamics of speculative prices is due to Bachelier [10], who in his doctoral thesis developed the first mathematical model concerning the behavior of stock prices. The systematic study of informational efficiency begun in the 1960s, when financial economics was born as a new area within economics. The classical definition due to Eugene Fama [11] says that a market is informationally efficient if it ‘‘fully reflect all available information’’. Therefore, the key element in assessing efficiency is to determine the appropriate set of information that impels prices. Following [12], informational efficiency can be divided into three categories: (i) weak efficiency, if prices reflect the information contained in the past series of prices, (ii) semi-strong efficiency, if prices reflect all public information and (iii) strong efficiency, if prices reflect all public and private information. As a corollary of the EMH, one cannot accept the presence of long memory in financial time series, since its existence would allow a riskless profitable trading strategy. If markets are informationally efficient, arbitrage prevent the possibility of such strategies.\n",
    "An important part of the literature focused its attention on studying the long-range dependence. If we consider the financial market as a dynamical structure, short term memory can exist (to some extent) without contradicting the EMH. In fact, the presence of some mispriced assets is the necessary stimulus for individuals to trade and reached an (almost) arbitrage free situation. However, the presence of long range memory is at odds with the EMH, because it would allow an stable trading rule to beat the market.\n",
    "Given the novelty of Bitcoin, this is one of the first papers (probably with the single exception of [13]) to study the Hurst exponent of this market. Previous works on long range dependence focused their attention in stocks, bonds or commodities markets. In particular, [14,15] use the Hurst exponent to detect the presence of long memory in the US and the UK stock markets, respectively. In [16] positive short term autocorrelation and negative long term autocorrelation is found, after examining the returns of a diversified portfolio of the NYSE. This result reinforces the idea of an underlying mean-reverting process. Long memory is also found in the Spanish stock market [17] and the Turkish stock market [18]. In the same line, Barkoulas et al. [19] finds evidence of long memory in the weekly returns of the Athens Stock Exchange during the period 1981–1990, and suggest that the strength of the memory could be influenced by the market size. Also long memory behavior in the Greek market was found by Panas [20]. Cajueiro and Tabak [21] find that developed markets are more informationally efficient than emerging markets and that the level of efficiency is influenced by market size and trading costs. Cajueiro and Tabak [22] relate long-range dependence with specific financial variables of the firms under examinations. Zunino and coworkers [23] find that the long-range memory in seven Latin-American markets is time varying. In this line, Bariviera [24] finds evidence of a time varying long-range dependence in daily returns of Thai Stock Market during the period 1975–2010 and concludes that it is weakly influenced by the liquidity level and market size. Vodenska et al. [25] show that volatility clustering in the S & P 500 index produces memory in returns. [26] finds long memory in the sign of transactions but not in the signs of returns. Ureche-Rangau and de Rorthays, [27] investigate the presence of long memory in volatility and trading volume of the Chinese stock market. Cajueiro and Tabak [28] present empirical evidence of time-varying long- range dependence for US interest rates. It concludes that long memory has reduced over time. Moreover, Cajueiro and Tabak [29] find that this long-range dependence, is affected by the monetary policy. Similarly, Cajueiro and Tabak [30] find long range dependence in Brazilian interest rates and their volatility, providing important implications for monetary studies. Time-varying long range dependence in Libor interest rates is found in [31,32]. The authors conclude that such behavior is consistent with the Libor rate rigging scandal. Cheung and Lai [33] use the fractional differencing test for long memory by [34] and find evidence of long memory in 5 out of the 18 markets under study. Using a different methodology, [35] applies spectral regression to time series of 30 firms, 7 sector indices and 2 broad stock indices at daily and monthly frequency, and finds evidence of long memory only in 5 of the individual firms. Wright [36] compares the memory content of the time series in developed and emerging stock markets, finding that the latter exhibits short term serial correlation in addition to long-range memory. Henry [37] concludes that there is strong evidence of long-range memory in the Korean market and some weak evidence on the German, Japanese and Taiwanese markets, after analyzing monthly returns of nine stock markets. Also, Tolvi [38] uses a sample of 16 stock markets of OECD countries and finds evidence of long memory only in 3 of them and Kasman et al. [39] finds that among the four main central European countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovak Republic), only the last one exhibits long memory. Cheong [40] computes the Hurst exponent by means of three heuristic methods and find evidence of long memory in the returns of five Malaysian equity market indices. This study finds that the Asian economic crisis affected the extent of long-range memory of the Malaysian stock market.\n",
    "With respect to the fixed income market, Carbone [41] finds local variability of the correlation exponent in the German stock and sovereign bond markets. Bariviera et al. [42] finds empirical evidence of long memory in corporate and sovereign bond markets and detects that the current financial crisis affects more the informational efficiency of the corporate than sovereign market. Zunino et al. [43], using the complexity-entropy causality plane for a sample of thirty countries, finds that informational efficiency is related to the degree of economic development. Recently, Bariviera et al. [44] finds that the long range memory of corporate bonds at European level are affected unevenly during the financial crisis. In particular, sectors closely related to financial activities were the first to exhibit a reduction in the informational efficiency.\n",
    "There are some works that find no evidence of long memory in the financial time series. Among others we can cite Lo [45], in the returns of US stocks, and Grau-Carles [46] in the stock indices of US, UK, Japan and Spain.\n",
    "As we can appreciate, the empirical studies on sovereign and corporate bond markets and stock markets are abundant. Giving the increasing amounts involved in Bitcoin trading, we believe that this topic deserves a detailed study.\n",

    "Robert J. Shiller, 2014\n",
    "\n",
    "I will start this lecture with some general thoughts on the determinants of long-term asset prices such as stock prices or home prices: what, ultimately, drives these prices to change as they do from time to time and how can we interpret these changes? I will consider the discourse in the profession about the role of rationality in the formation of these prices and the trend toward behavioral finance and, more broadly, behavioral economics, the growing acceptance of the importance of alter- native psychological, sociological, and epidemiological factors as affecting prices. I will focus on the statistical methods that allow us to learn about the sources of price volatility in the stock market and the housing market, and evidence that has led to the behavioral finance revolution in financial thought in recent decades.\n",
    "The broader purpose here is to appreciate the promise of financial technology. There is a great deal of popular skepticism about financial institutions afoot these days, after the financial and economic crisis that has dragged on ever since the sever- est days in 2008. I want to consider the possibilities for the future of finance in general terms, rather than focusing on current stopgap measures to deal opportunis- tically with symptoms of our current economic crisis. The talk about the rationality of markets is a precursor to this talk of financial technology, for it underpins our notions of the possibilities that new technology offers.\n",
    "I will conclude that the markets have already been \"human-factors-engineered\" to function remarkably well, and that as we improve our understanding of the kind of psychology that leads to bubbles and related problems, we can further innovate to improve the functioning of these markets.\n",

    "progressive accelerating ascent of the market price, reflecting an increasing built-up\n",
    "of the market cooperativity. From that point of view, the specific manner by which prices collapsed is not of real importance since, according to the concept of the critical\n",

    "divergence of the sensitivity and the growing instability of the market close to a critical\n",
    "point might explain why attempts to unravel the local origin of the crash have been\n",
    "so diverse. Essentially anything would work once the system is ripe. Our view is that\n",
    "the crash has an endogenous origin and that exogenous shocks only serve as triggering\n",
    "factors. We propose that the origin of crashes is much more subtle and is constructed\n",

    "The paper investigates the proprieties of Bitcoin in the financial markets. Specifically, we explore the conditional cross effects and volatility spillover between Bitcoin and financial indicators using different multivariate GARCH specifications. The nature of interaction between Bitcoin and financial variables and their transmission me- chanisms are taken into account when analyzing the diversification and hedging effectiveness across gold asset and stock market. Our findings suggest that all models confirm the significant returns and volatility spillovers. More importantly, we find that VARMA (1,1)-DCC-GJR-GARCH is the best-fit model for modeling the joint dynamics of a variety of financial assets. We also show that a short position in the Bitcoin market allows hedging the risk investment for all different financial assets. Finally, hedging strategies involving gold, oil, equities and Bitcoin reduce considerably the portfolio's risk, as compared to the risk of the portfolio made up of gold, oil and equities only.\n",

    "Cryptocurrencies are commonly perceived as a disruptive tech- nology that raises both hopes and fears in the minds of different cate- gories of stakeholders within the economy.1 In fact, Cryptocurrencies offer several potential benefits as innovative and efficient payment system but at the same time, they are the source of potential risks that could harm investors, consumers, businesses, financial systems and even the national security. The mixed views on cryptocurrencies and their future continue to be the driving force behind the excessive vo- latility of their market values. This has in turns attracted a growing interest from researchers in demystifying the complex world of cryp- tocurrencies which remains ambiguous and puzzling for the majority of market participants. Aiming to extend earlier research efforts, the present paper examines the conditional cross effects and volatility spillover between the most prominent cryptocurrency (i.e., Bitcoin) and a set of financial indicators.\n",
    "With a market capitalization close to seventeen billion dollars, Bitcoin is by far the most widely known cryptocurrency followed by its traditional competitors the Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and more recently Bitcoin Cash.2 Similar to other virtual currencies, Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that allows for the proof and transfer of its ownership without the need for an intermediary. By re- moving the need for intermediaries Bitcoin provides a more efficient infrastructure for the transfer of money, allowing for allow cheaper and faster payments. This lack of a regulatory framework became the cen- tral issue of the bulk of cryptocurrency literature focussing primarily on Bitcoin price mechanism and its ability to develop into an alternative monetary system (e.g., Becker et al., 2013; Brandvold, Molnár, Vagstad, & Valstad, 2015; Ciaian, Rajcaniova, & Kancs, 2016; Dwyer, 2015; Rogojanu & Badea, 2014; Segendorf, 2014).\n",
    "The sudden surge of volatility in the exchange rate of Bitcoin by the end of 2013 triggered another strand of studies examining the spec- ulative feature of Bitcoin (Baek & Elbeck, 2015; Dyhrberg, 2016b; Kristoufek, 2015; Yermack, 2015). For example, Kristoufek (2015) shows that Bitcoin price cannot be explained by economic theories, it is instead driven by speculation. In the same vein, Yermack (2015) con- cludes that Bitcoin resembles more like a speculative investment than like a true currency. Yermack's remarks were corroborated by influen- tial economists such as Robert Shiller, Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Roach who labelled Bitcoin as a typical example of a bubble waiting to burst (Monaghan, 2018). In an earlier statement, Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman stated that “You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is. I haven't been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.” (Kearns, 2013).\n",
    "The mystery around Bitcoin and its underpinning technology (i.e. blockchain) sparkled another debate on whether Bitcoin is a currency or a commodity (Buchholz, Delaney, Warren, & Parker, 2012; Dyhrberg, 2016a,b; Adjohani, Chourou, & Saadi, 2017; Cheah & Fry, 2015; Katsiampa, 2017; Pieters & Vivanco, 2017). Dyhrberg (2016a), for example, shows that Bitcoin exhibits many similarities to both the U.S. dollar and gold. Dyhrberg (2016b) adds that Bitcoin offers com- parable opportunities of hedging and safe haven as gold, and can be categorized somewhere in between gold and the US dollars. Baur, Dimpfl, and Kuck (2018), however, criticize the findings of Dyhrberg (2016a,b) and show that Bitcoin has distinctively different time series characteristics in comparison to other assets including gold and the US dollar.\n",
    "Following periods of financial turmoil experienced over the last decade, investors continue to look for alternative investment instru- ments that can offer diversification and/or hedging advantages. As it was the case with commodities in early 2000s, and because of its high average return and low correlation with major financial assets, Bitcoin could be a useful tool for portfolio management. However little is known from the literature on whether bitcoin can offer diversification advantages for a global market portfolio (Bouri, Peter Molnár, Azzi, Roubaud, & Hagfors, 2017). Dyhrberg (2016a) examined the nature of the relation between Bitcoin and FTSE stock index, USD/EUR and USD/ GBP exchange rates. Dyhrberg (2016b) explores the hedging cap- abilities of Bitcoin using a T-GARCH model, and finds that Bitcoin could be a hedging tool against the stock markets during period of turmoil. In line with Dyhrberg (2016b) show that Bitcoin could serve as a hedging tool against the U.S. dollar in the short run. Using a wavelet and quantile regression, Bouri et al. (2017) investigate the hedging behavior of the Bitcoin through analyzing a positive relationship between Bitcoin and global uncertainty. Bouoiyour and Selmi (2017) argue that Bitcoin exhibits the properties of weak safe haven in the short and long terms.\n",
    "In this paper, we extend the emerging literature on cryptocurrencies by analyzing the dynamic between Bitcoin and a selection of financial assets and see whether Bitcoin offers diversification and risk manage- ment benefits to investors. To do so we use a larger sample and recent time series data. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a fledgling re- lationship between Bitcoin and gold has emerged only by the end of 2017 (Landsman, 2018). Moreover, we propose a new empirical design based on various specifications to examine the conditional volatility dynamic of Bitcoin and other financial assets, and measure the condi- tional cross effects and volatility spillover between them. All the pro- posed models are rooted from VARMA (1,1)-DCC-GARCH by adding some potential characteristics likely to best describe the interaction between Bitcoin and financial assets.3 The nature of interaction be- tween Bitcoin and financial variables and their transmission mechan- isms are taken into account when analyzing the diversification and hedging effectiveness across the financial assets.\n",
    "Our empirical results suggest VARMA (1,1)-DCC-GJR-GARCH as the best model specification to describe the joint dynamics of Bitcoin and different financial assets. Second, we show that a short position in the Bitcoin market allow hedging the risk investment against all different financial assets. We also find that hedging strategies involving gold, oil, emerging stock markets and Bitcoin reduce considerably a portfolio's risk (variance), as compared to the risk of a portfolio composed of gold, oil and stocks from emerging stock only. Taken together, our results show that Bitcoin may offer diversification and hedging benefits for investors. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our empirical design. Section 3 presents the data and em- pirical findings. Section 4 concludes the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors are always looking for alternative investment instruments as part of diversified investment portfolios. Cryptocurrencies represent such an alternative because of their high average return and low correlation with financial assets. However, only a few studies have examined cryptocurrencies as hedging and diversification tools. To fill this gap in the literature, we examine the conditional cross effects and volatility spillover between Bitcoin and a set of financial assets using various model specifications extended from the DCC-GARCH models to identify appropriately the best-fit model.\n",

    "An important question remains: What does the future hold for Bitcoin as a diversifier and a hedging tool? The answer to this question is of great important to investors in the wake of uncertain regulatory environments around cryptocurrencies. Although digital currencies are unregulated in most countries, some major economies have regulation in place and others are studying the potential need to do so. As outlined in a comprehensive study of Bitcoin conducted by the Law Library of the U.S. Congress (2014, p. 1), “there is widespread concern about the Bitcoin system's possible impact on national currencies, its potential for criminal misuse, and the implications of its use for taxation.” Moreover, Bitcoin has a dark history of mishaps, especially with the Mt. Gox scandal, where hackers stole hundreds of millions of dollars through Bitcoin transactions. The uncertainties around future regulation and exposure of Bitcoin network to hacking activities can influence the design of optimal diversification and hedging strategies using Bitcoin. It would be interesting that future studies examine the role of Bitcoin to hedge against other financial assets before and after major changes in cryptocurrency regulation around the world.\n",

    "KEVIN DOWD, 2014\n",
    "\n",
    "A private money is a widely accepted medium of exchange or payment issued by a non-governmental body in the absence of any legal privileges. Private monies do not have to be generally acceptable; they merely have to be widely accepted. Three examples of contemporary private monetary systems are the Liberty Dollar, e-gold and cryptocurrencies. The former two are based on precious metals and the best-known instance of the latter is Bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "• There is a public demand for and interest in private currencies from various groups of people. Some wish to hold private currencies in the expectation that they will not diminish in purchasing power as state money has; some wish to conduct illegal activity; some wish to be part of a movement against increasing state control of economic and personal behaviour; and others just want better money.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The Liberty Dollar was based on a private mint that issued gold and silver coins; it also issued notes redeemable in precious metals. It was periodically revalued against the US dollar as the value of the latter fell over time against the precious metals. The Liberty Dollar was specifically designed to function in parallel with and in competition to the US dollar and never marketed or represented as official US currency.\n",
    "The Liberty Dollar was highly successful and became the second most popular currency in the US. Though initially tolerated, the US government turned against the Liberty Dollar, declared its use a federal crime and eventually secured a conviction against its founder for counterfeiting, fraud and conspiracy against the United States. This was an extraordinary result given that the purpose of the founders of the Liberty Dollar was to produce a currency that was distinct from but superior to the greenback dollar, and there was never any attempt to pass off the former for the latter.\n",

    "• e-gold was a private digital gold currency, a digital payment system in which the unit of account is\n",
    "gold and in which user accounts are backed by gold reserves. It was an ‘offshore’ payment system rather than a money transmitter or bank as defined under then-existing regulations, not least because gold was not legally ‘money’. By 2005, e-gold had grown to be second only to PayPal in the online payments industry: it had 1.2 million accounts and transactions that year totalled $1.5 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "• US law enforcement services also turned on e-gold and its principals were indicted in April 2007. The charges boiled down to e-gold being an unlicensed money-transmitting entity and a means of moving the proceeds of illegal activities with the principals’ tacit knowledge. These charges were never proven and even the judge in the e-gold case expressed major doubts about the government case.\n",

    "• The demand for Bitcoin has taken off since its launch in 2009 and it is increasingly used for both legal and illegal transactions, the latter thanks to its potential to achieve a very high degree of transactions anonymity. These illegal transactions include, most notoriously, its use to trade illegal drugs on the Silk Road dark web marketplace.\n",

Perhaps the safest prediction is that Bitcoin will eventually be displaced by alternative cryptocurrencies with superior features.\n",

    "This monograph examines contemporary private, or non- governmental, monetary systems. At one level, mention of a private monetary system has still not lost its capacity to shock: it raises connotations of individuals printing their own banknotes and putting them into circulation, or even minting their own coins. yet, at another level, privately is- sued money is familiar and commonplace, and all kinds of private money already circulate widely. Examples in- clude gift certificates, grocery store vouchers and Chuck E. Cheese tokens. Bank deposits are another example. In fact, most of the outstanding money in circulation is privately issued. However, my focus of interest is not on these famil- iar, sometimes regulated and frankly boring forms of pri- vate money but rather with unregulated or loosely regulat- ed varieties of private money that emerge spontaneously via market forces and operate outside government control: individuals printing their own currency or minting their own coins are perfect examples.\n",
    "Most private monetary systems consist of local paper currency or credit systems such as local economic trading systems (LETS), community mutual credit systems, time banks, local paper currency and company scrip, which was often issued as a means of payment when regular cur- rency was unavailable, such as in remote mining towns or on long voyages.1 They also include local private bank currency, such as the clearing house loan certificates and other forms of private emergency currency issued by US banks in the period before the founding of the Federal Reserve.2 Well-known contemporary examples in the US include Potomacs, Ithaca Hours and BerkShares. Innu- merable instances of these systems have been recorded over the years, and one would imagine that there must be many thousands of them operating in the US today. In fact, there are so many across the world that there is even a re- search journal devoted to them, the International Journal of Community Currency Research.3 A second form of private money is private coinage, which also has a long and suc- cessful – not to mention, colourful – history.4\n",
    "The subject of private money raises an important definitional issue: what exactly is private money? In this monograph, the term is used to refer to a widely accepted medium of exchange or payment issued by a non-govern- mental body in the absence of any legal privileges. The term ‘widely accepted medium of exchange’ is used rather than the more standard definition of a ‘generally accepted medium of exchange’ because no private money – apart from bank deposits which often are backed by some form of legal privilege or guarantee – can be regarded as gener- ally accepted.\n",
    "This working definition also requires that the money in question is not just issued by a non-governmental body\n",
    "– after all, the Federal Reserve is technically a private or- ganisation, as was the Bank of England until 1946. The money must also be issued in the absence of legal privilege or state guarantees. The latter qualifier rules out Federal Reserve currency as private money. We can therefore think of private money as generally operating on the fringes (at least) of the official monetary system, competing with offi- cial money, although some private monies have the poten- tial to displace official money altogether.\n",
    "A persistent and complex theme of historical private money systems is their often uneasy relationship with the state. The state has typically had a dual role towards them. In most cases it has been a destroyer. But, in other cases, it has been a creator of sorts, or at least an unwitting midwife. On the one hand, the typical response of the state has been to stamp out private money. The usual motive was the ob- vious one: private monetary systems were often seen as a threat to the ability of the state to raise seignorage and an affront to the prerogatives of the state itself. On the other hand, though the state never set out to do so, it was often the state that enabled these private monetary systems by creating the circumstances that led them to emerge in the first place. The system of clearing house loan certificates mentioned earlier is a good example: this was a direct consequence of the note issue restrictions of the National Banking System legislation of the 1860s. Another example is the bills of exchange system in early nineteenth-century Lancashire: this arose to fill a gap created by the refusal of the Bank of England to service the area properly combined with the legal inability of other banks to do so (see, for ex- ample, Baxendale 2011). In these and many other cases, private money emerged to fill a market niche that the state itself had created.\n",
    "This monograph focuses on three contemporary (and predominantly US) cases of private monetary systems that have received a lot of recent publicity:\n",
    "\n",
    "• The Liberty Dollar: this is a dollar-denominated gold- and silver-based monetary system that can function in an environment where the values of the precious metals have fluctuated greatly against the dollar.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Digital Gold Currency (DGC) with the focus on the best-known such system, e-gold: these are gold-based payments systems that proved to be particularly useful for international payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Bitcoin: this is the first successful example of the\n",
    "most recent form of private currency, cryptocurrency, and is path-breaking in a number of ways. It is a radical new type of currency based on the principles of strong cryptography; it has a novel production process – a form of digital ‘mining’ for want of a better description – that we have never seen before; it offers users the potential for anonymous and untraceable transactions; it runs itself and is the first ever private monetary system that is completely decentralised; it is not so much unregulated as ‘unregulatable’ and it apparently cannot be shut down. Bitcoin is truly revolutionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with their historical predecessors, all three cases illustrate that the US government still remains hostile to private money. Though both the Liberty Dollar and e-gold prove that there is a strong public demand for gold-based private money and were successful in providing it, they were attacked by the government and, after highly ques- tionable legal processes, their founders were convicted of criminal activities and their operations closed down. One can safely infer that the government would even more readily attack Bitcoin if it could, but it currently lacks the means to do so. Whereas the Liberty Dollar and e-gold were produced by identifiable individuals that the govern- ment could apprehend, Bitcoin is an altogether different proposition: it is an apparently unbreakable cryptocur- rency issued by an anonymous user network, widely used on anonymous hidden exchanges that the government cannot locate. It was promoted and designed by cyber (or, should I say, cypher) anarchists who openly aspire to shut down the government itself. The issues raised by contem- porary private monetary systems are, thus, far-reaching.\n",
    "This monograph is organised as follows. Chapter 2 examines the Liberty Dollar and Chapter 3 examines digital currency, with the emphasis on DGC systems and the case of e-gold. Chapter 4 describes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and then Chapter 5 discusses one of the most remarkable features of cryptocurrencies: their ability to protect individuals’ financial privacy and the profound implications that follow from that. It means, for example, that people are able to operate beyond government control and there are, of course, ensuing issues that are raised by a newly emerging anarchic social order. Chapter 6 concludes.\n",

    "Contemporary private money and the functions of money\n",
    "The modern private monies considered here are radical in their nature. To displace existing state currency they not only have to perform the basic functions of money at least as well as state money, they probably also need qualities that transcend the way in which state money works. The network benefits from the use of a single money are sub- stantial and the costs of changing from one network to an- other would be very large. Hence, for new private monies to achieve a significant market share, they have to demon- strate substantial benefits. Let us consider this issue from the perspective of the traditional functions of money.\n",
    "Money is expected to provide a measure of value or unit of account. It would seem that the new private monies do achieve this function, either by having their own denomi- nation (for example, Bitcoin) or by being denominated rel- ative to an existing unit of account (for example, Liberty Dollar). However, new monies do not have any obvious ad- vantage over existing monies in this respect.\n",
    "Money should be effective as a medium of exchange. To fulfil this purpose, it has to be sufficiently widely acceptable. However, money does not have to be generally acceptable across the whole population to be useful as a medium of exchange. It is true that there is a cost of using two currencies if one of those currencies is not generally acceptable (potential exchange costs and forgone inter- est costs of holding more cash, for example), but these are probably not especially significant. It is clear that Bitcoin has become acceptable for transactions in growing but mostly niche markets; for their part, the Liberty Dollar and e-gold achieved considerable market take-up but did not have the opportunity to become more widely acceptable because of government action taken against them. The regulatory risk attached to private monies is thus clearly substantial, though we can expect mechanisms of avoid- ing such risk to be increasingly important features of new forms of money – and the ability to evade such risk is of course one of the main attractions of Bitcoin.\n",
    "Thirdly, money should be a reasonable store of value. State money has not fulfilled this function well in the last eight decades at least.1 Before World War II, UK inflation history had been reasonably good for nearly 300 years, much of which was spent on a metallic gold standard. Those new private monies that are based on gold can be expected to be a better long-term store of value than state money, even if their value denominated in state currency might fluctuate from time to time. It is notable in this con- text that each of the three private monetary systems we have considered also imposes discipline on the over-issue of money, a discipline that is conspicuously lacking in con- temporary government monetary systems. I would suggest that this discipline is a central reason for the success that the private monetary systems have hitherto achieved.\n",
    "Fourthly, modern private monies can also be used as a standard for deferred payments, as long as creditor and debtor are willing to accept the price fluctuations of pri- vate money relative to state money.\n",
    "These case studies of contemporary private monetary systems indicate beyond any doubt that the demand for private money is very much alive and well – and private monetary systems have been successful so far because the money they provide is superior to that provided by the state, at least for certain purposes. They also demon- strate that any particular money does not have to have a monopoly (whether private or state) to achieve success in the marketplace: there is no ‘need’ for any monopoly in money.\n",
    "These private monetary systems – the Liberty Dollar and e-gold more obviously, but Bitcoin implicitly with its gold- like supply schedule – also point to the continuing allure of gold. The attraction of gold should hardly be a surprise given the record of fiat money since the last link to gold was cut in 1971. Since then, the US dollar has lost almost 85 per cent of its purchasing power even by official govern- ment statistics; for its part, sterling has lost 98 per cent of its value over the last century since the abandonment of the ‘High Gold Standard’ that existed before World War I.\n",
    "Regulation of contemporary private monies\n",
    "The experience of contemporary private monetary sys- tems shows that the only regulation they need is that by the market itself: in the provision of money as with the provision of other goods and services, the best outcomes are achieved by free competition. It is therefore important that more widespread adoption of private monies is not inhibited by the state. Such a response by the state would reduce consumer choice, reduce the competitive pressure on the state to maintain the quality of its currency and un- dermine financial freedom.\n",
    "Competition against the central bank should therefore be welcomed, not least as it would pressure the central bank to improve the quality of the currency it provides. With this objective in mind, governments should consider eliminating any and all regulatory or legal obstacles to the use of private monies. One fairly obvious reform would be to repeal repressive regulation against private currency\n",
    "– such as the current US prohibition against the private issue of coins. A second useful reform would be to ensure that courts will enforce contracts made in any currency, private, official or foreign, so long as the parties involved have entered into them freely. Thirdly, transactions in any private or foreign currency should not be put at any tax dis- advantage relative to transactions in the local official cur- rency: the guiding principle should be a level playing field. Note, too, that this would also imply the abolition of legal tender, by which parties to contracts can be compelled to accept a currency they would not freely choose. The princi- ple of a level playing field also implies that the government itself should be willing to accept private monies in tax pay- ments, should those monies become well established.\n",
    "The worst policy response to the challenges posed by private money is to try to suppress it. Above all, we need to move away from the medieval attitude that the issue of any form of money is a state prerogative.\n",
    "Cryptocurrencies and the transformation of society?\n",
    "The most radical and far-reaching private monetary sys- tems are the cryptocurrencies. At the broadest level and whatever its limitations and eventual fate, Bitcoin reminds us yet again of the ability of the private sector to produce astonishing innovations that are almost impossible to an- ticipate. To start with, the very existence of Bitcoin proves that anyone can create money that other people will ac- cept using a computer that takes as its only inputs an algo- rithm and computing power. This new currency is similar to a commodity money, such as gold, in so far as it is costly to produce and inelastic in supply.\n",
    "Bitcoin is truly radical in a number of other respects too. It is the first currency ever to achieve take-off despite having no commodity value. In this it differs from mod- ern fiat currencies that also have no commodity value but which started off as convertible currencies and had the commodity link later severed. Bitcoin also differs from\n",
    "conventional note and deposit money in that it can in no way be construed as debt. Another breakthrough is that Bitcoin provides a novel solution to the trust problem: instead of relying on any individual or organisation, it achieves trust using a peer-to-peer network. Furthermore, once it was up and running, Bitcoin became independent of any individuals or organisations and can therefore con- tinue without them – it has no single point of failure – and this makes it very hard to shut down. Finally, Bitcoin has the potential to achieve a very high degree of anonymity. These features open up almost unimaginable possibilities for private parties to free themselves from state control – to buy illegal drugs, engage in illegal forms of gambling, evade taxes, protect their wealth from the government, and so on. This, in turn, raises profound issues of an emerg- ing spontaneous social order, in particular, the prospect of a crypto-anarchic society in which there is no longer any government role in the monetary system and, potentially, no government at all.\n",

    "## Modelling crypto currencies Financial Time–Series\n",
    "Leopoldo Cataniaa, Stefano Grassib\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper studies the behaviour of crypto currencies financial time–series of which Bitcoin is the most prominent example. The dynamic of those series is quite complex displaying extreme observations, asymmetries, and several nonlinear characteristics which are difficult to model. We develop a new dynamic model able to account for long–memory and asymmetries in the volatility process as well as for the presence of time–varying skewness and kurtosis. The empirical application, carried out on 606 crypto currencies, indicates that a robust filter for the volatility of crypto currencies is strongly required. Forecasting results show that the inclusion of time–varying skewness systematically improves volatility, density, and quantile predictions at different horizons. Going forward, as this new and unexplored market will develop, our results will be important for asset allocation, risk management, and pricing of derivative securities.\n",

    "Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency created in 2009 and documented in Nakamoto (2009). Since its inception, it gained a growing attention from the media, academics, and finance industry. The reasons for this are several, just to name few: Japan and South Korea have recognized Bitcoin as a legal method of payment (Bloomberg, 2017a; Cointelegraph, 2017); some central banks are exploring the use of the crypto currencies (Bloomberg, 2017b); a large number of companies and banks created the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance1 to make use of the crypto currencies and the related technology called blockchain, (Forbes, 2017). Finally the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) started to negotiate Bitcoin futures on 18th of December 2017, see Exchange (2017), and Facebook has lunched his own cryptocurrency ’Libra’, Economist (2019). All this interest has been reflected on the crypto currencies market capitalization that exploded from around 19 billion in February 2017 to around 800 billion in December 2017 and around 3000 cryptocurrencies are available at the time of writing.2 Although Bitcoin can be considered to be relatively new, there has already been some initial analysis into the crypto–currency: Hencic and Gourieroux (2014) applied a non–causal autoregressive model to detect the presence of bubbles in the Bitcoin/USD exchange rate, Sapuric and Kokkinaki (2014) measure volatility of Bitcoin exchange rate against six major currencies, Bianchi (2019) analyzes whether crypto-currencies can be considered as a standard asset class, Schilling and Uhlig (2019) study their monetary policy implications.\n",
    "From a statistical perspective, Chu et al. (2015) provide an analysis of the log–returns of the exchange rate of Bitcoin versus the USD and found that the Generalized Hyperbolic distribution seems to be the most appropriate choice to model the unconditional distribution of crypto currencies time–series. Few studies have analyzed the cryptocurrency predictability. For instance, Hotz-Behofsits et al. (2018) applied a time-varying parameter VAR with t-distributed measurement errors and stochastic volatility to model cryptocurrencies, Catania et al. (2018) studied cryptocurrencies’ predictability using several alternative univariate and multivariate models. Griffin and Shams (2018) investigated whether Tether (another cryptocurrency backed by Dollar) is directly manipulating the price of Bitcoin increasing its predictability, see also Gandal et al. (2018).\n",
    "The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we develop a dynamic updating equation for the volatility of a time–series exploiting the information contained in the score of the conditional distribution of the data, which is assumed to follow the Generalized Hyperbolic Skew Student’s t law (GHSKT); this distribution is detailed in Aas and Haff (2006) and obtained as a limiting case of the Generalized Hyperbolic family (Barndorff-Nielsen, 1977). This dynamic model can be thought of as a special case of the multivariate model introduced by Lucas et al. (2014) and Lucas et al. (2017) and belongs to the score driven class of models recently introduced by Creal et al. (2013) and Harvey (2013).\n",
    "Our contribution extends that of Lucas et al. (2014) and Lucas et al. (2017) in several directions, namely we: i) derive expressions in order to apply the model in a univariate framework, these cannot be easily recovered from Lucas et al. (2014), ii) investigate in deep the characteristics of the filter implied for the volatility update, especially the implications of the asymmetric tail behaviour of the GHSKT distribution, and iii) extend the model in order to account for several features such as the presence of leverage effects (Black, 1976); long memory properties of the volatility process and time–varying higher order moments. Furthermore, we report a Monte Carlo experiment in order to investigate the finite sample properties of the Maximum Likelihood estimator.\n",
    "The second contribution of this paper is empirical. Specifically, we concentrate on the dynamic properties of crypto currencies financial time–series and not on their unconditional distribution as in previous studies, see Chu et al. (2015). Moreover, we investigate a large set of crypto currencies, which to the best of our knowledge has not been done yet. We do so by reporting in–sample aggregate results for the universe of cryptocurrencies as well as for subgroups according to their market capitalization. Detailed results for the four major cryptocurrencies are also reported. Beside studying the volatility process of hundreds of cryptocurrencies, we also report a comparison of the proposed volatility specification to the well–known GARCH model of Bollerslev (1986). It is generally acknowledge that score driven models report better volatility estimates than GARCH in the presence of extreme observations (see e.g. Creal et al. 2013, Harvey and Luati 2014 and Bernardi and Catania 2016), however, many scientific articles3 using GARCH–type models with the Bitcoin series (which is notoriously characterised by a large number of extreme observations) have appeared.4 Therefore, another contribution of our study is to warn researchers and practitioners to the use non–robust volatility models (like GARCH) with cryptocurrencies which might lead to misleading results in financial applications like option pricing and portfolio optimization. We conclude our empirical analysis by reporting a large scale forecasting study. Our analysis indicates that incorporating time– varying skewness significantly improves on volatility, risk measures, and density predictions. Results are robust when considering different levels of market capitalization and forecast horizon. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the basic model. Section 3 reports the Monte Carlo experiment. Section 4 reports the extensions of the model in order to incorporate: leverage effects, long memory into the volatility process, and time–varying higher order moments. Section 5 provides the main empirical contributions of the paper. Section 6 draws some conclusions.\n",

    "In this paper, we analyzed the behaviour of crypto currencies financial time–series of which Bitcoin is the most prominent example. The dynamic of those series is quite complex displaying extreme observations, asymmetries, and several nonlinear characteristics which are difficult to model. To accommodate those features, we developed a model able to incorporate: long memory, leverage effect, and time–varying higher order moments. The finite sample properties of the Maximum Likelihood estimator have been investigated via a Monte Carlo experiment. Results show that the MLE performs well in term of the bias and RMSE also in small samples. In the empirical application we apply this model to 606 crypto currencies and we concentrate on the main four: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin. We found that a robust filter for the volatility of crypto currencies time–series is strongly required by the data. Our forecast analysis indicated that incorporating time–varying skewness significantly improves on volatility, risk measures, and density predictions. Results are robust when considering different levels of market capitalization and forecast horizon. Overall, our suggestion for investors and risk managers is to implement a robust specification (like a score driven specification with a fat tailed conditional distribution) with the inclusion of time–varying skewness, especially if the goal is to analyse a large number of crypto currencies.\n",

    "## Popping the Bitcoin Bubble: An application of log-periodic power law modeling to digital currency\n",
    "Alec MacDonell, 2014\n",
    "\n",
    "The year 2013 witnessed a remarkable increase in public interest and awareness of digital currencies such as Bitcoin. Hailed by some as the currency of the future, these “cryptocurrencies” have gained notoriety for their use in online black markets, but have yet to gain widespread acceptance. Given their novelty and lack of central regulating authorities, digital currencies experience high volatility and uncertainty regarding value. Taking Bitcoin as a representative example, this paper first uses autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to explain trading values, then applies log-periodic power law (LPPL) models in an attempt to predict crashes. The results of ARMA modeling show that Bitcoin values react to the CBOE Volatility Index, suggesting that a primary force currently driving Bitcoin values is speculation by investors looking outside traditional markets. In addition, the LPPL models accurately predict ex-ante the crash that occurred in December 2013, making LPPL models a potentially valuable tool for understanding bubble behavior in digital currencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional instruction in economics teaches that currency takes one of two forms – commodity money or fiat money. Commodity money, typified by gold, relies on a rare, tangible substance capable of serving as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Fiat money, (e.g. the U.S. dollar or the Euro) has no intrinsic value, but instead relies on the backing of a central authority that guarantees its worth. The last several years have witnessed the introduction of cryptocurrencies – digital currencies that rely on cryptography to ensure security – which cannot be accurately defined as either commodity or fiat money. They exist online, not in real space, and there is no authority guaranteeing their value. As such, their value is not explicitly tied to one nation’s economic success, nor can it be directly influenced by a central authority’s fiscal or monetary policy. Intangible, floating, and unregulated, cryptocurrencies seem to occupy a category all their own.\n",
    "The first successful cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which began trading in 2009. Since then, dozens of other cryptocurrencies have been introduced, many based on the Bitcoin model. Some are created for a specific purpose – Namecoin, for instance, attempts to create a new domain name system outside of conventional regulation. This would, in theory, make it much harder to control or suppress content on the Internet. Other cryptocurrencies are created as mediums of exchange for specific groups – Dogecoin is a currency used almost exclusively by members of Reddit, a popular social media site. In January 2014, Redditors used Dogecoin to raise $30,000 to help fund the Jamaican bobsled team in their bid for the Sochi Winter Olympics. For the purposes of this investigation, I will focus on Bitcoin as a proxy for digital currencies in general. Not only is Bitcoin the oldest cryptocurrency in\n",
    "circulation, it is also by far the best known and most valuable. While some digital currencies trade into U.S. dollars at a rate of fractions of a cent per coin, Bitcoin values have risen at times over $1000 per coin, making the movements in the data far more significant.\n",
    "This paper has two goals: first, to identify the factors that drive the value of Bitcoins, second, to test whether it is possible to successfully anticipate crashes in Bitcoin values. My hypothesis is that the value of the Bitcoin is primarily driven by two variables – the level of public interest over time and the level of investor confidence in traditional markets. The first variable reflects Bitcoin’s newness as a currency. The relatively low number of currently available markets limits the potential use of Bitcoins as an actual currency used to buy and sell goods and services. However, as media attention increases, the probability of widespread adoption should increase correspondingly, endowing the Bitcoin with greater potential as a medium of exchange. The second variable looks at Bitcoins as a vehicle for investment. As economic uncertainty increases and traditional investment avenues become less stable, investors may look to shelter their wealth in other places, as seen in the demand for gold during the recent recession. Bitcoins, given their decentralized structure, could feasibly remain insulated from economic downturns and provide a potential store of value.\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, I used maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the parameters of the Bitcoin value model. Variables were added to the model based on their statistical significance and their affect on the Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (SBC). The only exogenous variable that came into the final model was the Chicago Board of Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatility Index (VIX). The effect, however, was the opposite of the one stated in my hypothesis – Bitcoin values rise as the VIX falls. The effects of the VIX on Bitcoin values imply that when volatility in traditional markets is low, investors seek out Bitcoin precisely because its high volatility provides opportunities for speculation. No variables representing Bitcoin as a real medium of exchange came into the final model, implying that values are driven almost entirely by investors, not consumers.\n",
    "Given the extreme volatility of Bitcoin values, a forecast based on my model yields wide confidence intervals. To mitigate this high level of uncertainty, there exists a need to anticipate critical points where values are likely to crash. Several authors (Johansen et al. 2000, Lin et al. 2009, Geraskin & Fantazzini 2010) have had success applying log-periodic power law (LPPL) models to historical financial bubbles to predict the timing of crash events. Based on the idea that crashes are preceded by faster-than-exponential growth, these models filter for several criteria that distinguish this behavior. An application of LPPL models to Bitcoin data over the three last years demonstrated that the models were able to predict the crash that occurred in December 2014. This successful prediction opens up the possibility of using LPPL models to understand future behavior in Bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n",
    "The rest of the paper will be laid out as follows: Section 2 sets up the historical and theoretical background necessary to understand Bitcoins as a currency. Section 3 presents a summary of the data and the steps taken to produce a stable model. Section 4 discusses the theories on financial bubbles, and Section 5 outlines the specifications of LPPL\n",

    "modeling. Section 6 explains the application of LPPL models to the December 2013 Bitcoin crash, and Section 7 discusses the results and implications of both the ARMA and LPPL models.\n",
    "2 Background\n",
    "Bitcoins were launched in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakomoto created the original Bitcoin software and published a proof of concept focusing on the system’s security. Bitcoin differed from previous digital currencies by eliminating the need for a trusted third party – transactions were verified by the combined power of all participating computers. Bitcoins could not be seized from other users without obtaining their private digital signatures, and a single user could not fraudulently spend Bitcoins without possessing computing power greater than that of all other honest users combined. The project continued as an open-source development, incorporating contributions and ideas from programmers all over the world. Due to the limited number of legal venues for spending Bitcoins, their use generally falls into one of two buckets: first, a medium for anonymously purchasing goods and services (often of questionable legality) over the Internet, and second, a vehicle for investment similar to gold or forex trading.\n",
    "At the time they began trading on Mt. Gox, the largest online Bitcoin exchange, one Bitcoin was roughly equivalent to a U.S. nickel – 5 cents – in value. Over the next two years, this value rose slowly, breaking $1 in early 2012 and eventually reaching values between $10 and $20. Suddenly, in late March of 2013, Bitcoin trading values began a rapid escalation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of one month, Bitcoin values increased sixfold from just under $40 to a high of $230. The spike may have been initiated by an economic crisis in Cyprus, which saw the small nation’s credit rating plummet to junk status (Detrixhe 2013). With mounting uncertainty over the future of Cyprus’ banks, investors, eager to find other havens for their assets, began to buy into Bitcoins, pushing trading volumes and values to historic highs (Cohan 2013). In the following months, Bitcoin values settled back down to the low $100s, though with greater variance than pre-spike.\n",
    "On October 2, 2013, the U.S. government shut down the Silk Road, an online black market known as the “Amazon.com of illegal drugs” (NPR 2011). The FBI arrested the site’s founder and seized over 26,000 Bitcoins, worth $3.6 million, generating widespread speculation on the future of the currency and the government’s stance on its legality. Finally, in mid-November, the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged Bitcoins as a “legal means of exchange” and expressed a generally positive opinion of the currency. Trading values climbed immediately, soon breaking $1000.\n",
    "Bitcoin values hit an all-time high on December 4, 2013, closing at $1238. Over the next three days, values collapsed, dropping back down below $700. There was a brief recovery period, followed by further drops until December 18, when values bottomed out at $541. Since that time, values have fluctuated between $600 and $1000, and the amount of data since the crash is still too small to assume any trend.\n",

    "Though gaining acceptance, Bitcoin is a nascent currency and its fate is undetermined. The underlying system is cryptographically secure, but there remain weak points that a malicious attacker might seek to exploit. If a hacker were to compromise the security of an individual’s computer or one of the exchanges on which Bitcoins are traded, he or she might be able to steal Bitcoins from other users. As responses to this threat become more sophisticated, Bitcoin values will likely experience some stabilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "I originally hypothesized that Bitcoin values would be driven both by their worth as a medium of exchange and by their use as a vehicle for investment. However, after testing several variables in the model, the only exogenous variable shown to have any statistical significance was the CBOE Volatility Index. This suggests that, at present, investor behavior matters, but consumer behavior does not.\n",
    "There are several possible explanations. It could simply be the case that investors make up the largest percentage of Bitcoin users. Since there are relatively few vendors that accept Bitcoins as legal tender, use of Bitcoins to buy goods and services may still be too minimal to have an effect on Bitcoin values. On the other hand, it could be the case that there are quite a few consumers who use Bitcoins as a currency, but their spending behavior and demographics cannot be tracked. We know that online black markets exist and that they use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange; nevertheless, there is no good way to accurately track spending in black markets. Finally, it could be the case that news mentions are not a good enough proxy for consumer participation, and therefore do not really parallel the effects of consumer behavior on Bitcoin values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the effects of investor behavior, the model suggests that as the VIX rises, Bitcoin values fall. While this contradicts the original hypothesis that fear and uncertainty would drive investors to shelter their money in Bitcoin, it can still be explained in a manner consistent with investor behavior. The inverse relationship between Bitcoin and VIX values suggests that when the VIX is low, that is, when there is relatively little volatility in the S&P 500, investors push money towards Bitcoins. As noted earlier, Bitcoins have a great deal of volatility, which potentially allows for greater return on investment. Investors might therefore choose to speculate on Bitcoins not because they seek to shelter money, but rather because they wish to gamble in the hopes that Bitcoins will offer a higher return than the market.\n",
    "Ultimately, the most notable aspect of this forecast is the uncertainty. Confidence intervals are very wide, so the overall confidence in the point forecast is low. With such high volatility, the best an investor or user of Bitcoins could hope for is to have advance warning of dramatic crashes. Fortunately, log-periodic power law models appear to be capable of distinguishing critical periods in Bitcoin trading. Using only data from before the event, LPPL models successfully predicted that a crash was impending. To be fair, the models overshot the date of the crash by two days, but, as Bitcoin trading continues, larger data sets should allow for more accurate predictions.\n",
    "The successful application of LPPL modeling to Bitcoin also holds promise for use on other digital currencies, most of which experience similar volatility. There is abundant room for further research in this arena – whether digital currencies will remain simply a vehicle for\n",

    "## Bitcoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency\n",
    "by REUBEN GRINBERG, 2011\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is a digital, decentralized, partially anonymous currency, not backed by any government or other legal entity, and not redeemable for gold or other commodity. It relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.1 Its proponents argue that Bitcoin has many properties that could make it an ideal currency for mainstream consumers and merchants. For example, bitcoins are highly liquid, have low transaction costs, can be used to send payments quickly across the internet, and can be used to make micropayments. This new currency could also hold the key to allowing organizations such as Wikileaks, hated by governments, to receive donations and conduct business anonymously.2\n",
    "Amazingly, as of October 2011, a bitcoin (currency ticker BTC) is worth about two U.S. Dollars (USD), there are about $20 million worth of bitcoins in existence,3 there are probably around 20,000 Bitcoin users,4 and over $300,000 worth of bitcoins are traded every day.5\n",
    "Although the Bitcoin economy is flourishing, users are anxious about Bitcoin’s legal status and the possibility of a government crackdown.6 Some point to Bitcoin’s ability, like all digital and anonymous currencies, to facilitate money laundering, tax evasion, and trade in illegal drugs and child pornography.7 Indeed, the U.S. government prosecuted and shut down the creators of e-gold, a digital currency backed by gold, under state and federal laws for conspiracy to commit money laundering, and also for providing services to those involved in “child exploitation, credit card fraud, and wire (investment) fraud.”8 Others point to governments’ purported interests in protecting their economies and monopolies on minting new money.9 These individuals point to the successful prosecution and conviction of the creator of the Liberty Dollar, a paper and coin- based currency backed by gold and other precious metals.10\n",
    "Part II explains how Bitcoin works and Part III describes its nascent ecosystem of websites and services. Part IV compares Bitcoin to its competition, including payment processors like PayPal and digital gold currencies. Part V explores whether Bitcoin can be a sustainable currency and why individuals would trust a currency not supported by any legal institution and not redeemable for any commodity. Part VI explores a few of the many legal ramifications of Bitcoin, including statutes supposedly aimed at enforcing the federal government’s monopoly on issuing currency and securities regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is novel digital currency that has the potential to be a significant player in the micropayment and virtual world commerce markets. It is also a great alternative currency for gold bugs who prefer to hold currencies fully backed by commodities. Furthermore, because it is anonymous and decentralized, and therefore difficult to shut down, it may allow organizations hated by governments— whether these are morally commendable or detestable organizations—to be funded without risk of monetary seizure or sanctions on financial contributors.\n",
    "While the history of currencies such as the Iraqi Swiss Dinar that had no backing by either commodities or government entities indicates that Bitcoin may succeed, potential users and investors should be aware of the many risks inherent in using such a young technology.\n",
    "Most importantly, Bitcoin currently operates in a legal grey area. The federal government’s supposed monopoly on issuing currency is somewhat narrow and statutes that impose that monopoly do not seem to apply to Bitcoin due to its digital nature. However, a bitcoin may be a “security” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, subjecting bitcoins to a vast regime of regulations, including general antifraud rules. Although the best argument is that a bitcoin is not a security, Bitcoin’s proponents will have to await an SEC or court interpretation for certainty. Furthermore, other legal issues that have not been analyzed in this Article are probably significant, including tax evasion, banking without a charter, state escheat statutes, and money laundering.\n",

    "## Datestamping the Bitcoin and Ethereum bubbles\n",
    "Shaen Corbeta, Brian Lucey⁎,b, Larisa Yarovayac, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "We examine the existence and dates of pricing bubbles in Bitcoin and Ethereum, two popular cryptocurrencies using the (Phillips et al., 2011) methodology. In contrast to previous papers, we examine the fundamental drivers of the price. Having derived ratios that are economically and computationally sensible, we use these variables to detect and datestamp bubbles. Our conclu- sion is that there are periods of clear bubble behaviour, with Bitcoin now almost certainly in a bubble phase.\n",
    "Are there bubbles in cryptocurrencies? If so, when do they manifest? Or are the rises due to more fundamental characteristics of the assets construction. We examine two of the largest, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The European Central Bank (2012) found that cryptocurrencies do not jeopardise financial stability, due to their limited connection to the real economy, the low volumes traded and the lack of wide user acceptance. This ECB conclusion in 2012 was associated with the caveat that the growth of cryptocurrency markets and their integration to the global economy must be monitored, since cryptocurrencies remain the potential source of financial instability. In the five years since the release of this report, the market for crytocurrencies has evolved significantly. Fig. 1 portrays the substantial price appreciation that has been observed in Bitcoin since 2013. To provide assurances and clarity with regards to broad financial stability, it is important to clarify as to whether this substantial increase in price has been predominantly driven by underlying fundamentals, or whether it can be denoted as a speculative bubble.\n",
    "The aim of this paper is to test whether underlying fundamentals relating to both Bitcoin and Ethereum, denoted as the blockchain position, the hashrate and liquidity as measured by the volume of daily transactions, can be designated as drivers of price growth since the inception of both cryptocurrencies. Having derived ratios that are economically and computationally sensible we then use these measures to detect and datestamp bubbles. The three measures were selected to best represent the key theoretical components of cyrptocurrency pricing structures. The first measure relates to mining difficulty reflects how difficult it is to find a new block relative to the easiest that it could be in the past. As more miners join, the rate of block creation will increase, which causes the difficulty to increase in compensation to push the rate of block creation back down. The second measure relates to hashrate which is the speed at which a computer is completing an operation in the Bitcoin code. A higher hashrate when mining increases your opportunity of finding the next block and receiving payments. Finally, the relationship between cryptocurrency returns, volatility and liquidity has been established by Donier and Bouchaud (2015) and (Balcilar et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper provides insight into the relationship between the relationship of cryptocurrency pricing discovery and internal fundamental explanatory variables that can generate the conditions and environment in which a pricing bubble can thrive. Based on the above presented analysis, we conclude that there is no clear evidence of such a persistent bubble in the market for both Bitcoin or Ethereum. This does not imply that the price is “correct”, merely a statistical indicator being absent. Considering the theoretical interlinkages between the price of both Bitcoin and Ethereum and their relationship with blockchain position, hashrate and liquidity, respectively, we can state that there are distinct short-term time period in which each fundamental influences the price dynamics of both crytocurrency, however, these effects dissipate quickly. However, we do find evidence that supports the view that Bitcoin is currently in a bubble phase and has been since the price increased above $1000.\n",

    "## Exogenous and endogenous market crashes as phase transitions in complex financial systems\n",
    "J.M. Fry, 2012\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper we provide a unifying framework for a set of seemingly disparate models for exogenous and endogenous shocks in complex financial systems. Markets operate by balancing intrinsic levels of risk and return. This remains true even in the midst of transitory exogenous and endogenous shocks. Changes in market regime (bearish to bullish and bullish to bearish) can be explicitly shown to represent a phase transition from random to deterministic behaviour in prices. The resulting models refine the empirical analysis in a number of previous papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a burgeoning literature discussing endoge- nous/exogenous dynamics in complex systems [1–7]. This includes various applications to financial and social sys- tems [4] including book sales [5,6], financial markets [8] and internet downloads [9]. This has occurred alongside various inter-related models for financial crash precur- sors [10–13]. This makes use of the oft-cited analogy be- tween financial market crashes and phase transitions in critical phenomena, based upon lattice models in statisti- cal physics [13]. The literature thus provides a series of es- sentially separate models for crash-precursors [10–13] and for associated after-shock patterns [8,14].\n",
    "This paper provides a novel framework unifying this seemingly disparate set of models. Financial markets op- erate by balancing an intrinsic rate of return against an intrinsic level of risk. The analogy between regime-changes in financial markets and phase transitions in critical phe- nomena emerges as a key theme in the literature. In our model such changes can be shown to have an explicit rep- resentation as a phase transition from random to deter- ministic behaviour in prices (see Eqs. (10) and (29)).\n",
    "In terms of empirical applications our model for exoge- nous shocks refines similar analyses conducted in [8,15]. Our model for speculative bubbles allows a more system- atic treatment of log-periodic and related models for finan- cial crashes and can be shown to lead to several interesting empirical applications discussed in [16–18].\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper provides a unifying framework for a seemingly disparate set of models for endogenous [13] and exogenous crashes [8,15]. Financial markets function by balancing an intrinsic rate of return against an intrinsic level of risk. This feature is easy to lose sight of – particularly during bubbles and the introduction of new technologies/influx of new investors [19]. Our model also makes explicit the oft-cited link between financial crashes and phase tran- sitions and critical phenomena. In particular, changes of market regime (bullish to bearish; Sect. 2.1) and (bearish to bullish; Sect. 2.2) are identified with a transition from random to deterministic behaviour in prices. Our model for exogenous shocks refines the analysis in [8,15]. We see our model for endogenous bubbles as an alternative to the log-periodic models that have prevailed in the literature.\n",
    "Calibration of log-periodic models to financial data is very involved [31]. Our model retains the explicit analogy be- tween physical and financial systems, but, as can be seen from equations (31)–(33) is computationally simpler and arguably more objective – an issue which may be signifi- cant given previous disputes [25–27,43–45].\n",
    "Several novel empirical applications of the models in Sections 2 are possible. Here, in our empirical applica- tion, we restrict attention to exogenous crashes. We ex- amine the market response to putative exogenous shocks; the attempted coup against USSR’s President Gorbachev and the terror attacks of 9/11. The 1991 coup does not constitute a significant exogenous effect upon global fi- nancial markets. Results are either indistinguishable from background noise or in the case of Japan’s Nikkei index appear linked instead to the recession of the early 1990s and Japan’s “lost decade”. In contrast, the terror attacks of 9/11 are seen to represent an exogenous shock. Evi- dence of a power-law decay in volatility is found, with estimated exponent α = 0.62 ± 0.5 slightly higher than the value of 0.5 suggested in [8]. Losses on the S&P 500 in Spring 2002 can be explicitly linked to a preceding speculative bubble. The crash on the Nasdaq in April 2000 appears to have been triggered exogenously once a preced- ing speculative bubble primed the market for a crash. The credit and stock bubble notwithstanding, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers constitutes an exogenous event.\n",
    "The models for endogenous and exogenous market crashes suggest a number of applications to risk manage- ment and several interesting avenues for further research. This paper sits alongside wider work on financial aspects of societal resilience [46] and future work will examine the implications for economic policy [47] and towards a more systematic treatment of market psychology and related themes discussed in [48].\n",

    "what such a transition would imply for the Swedish society. To deliver a thorough analysis, the\n",

    "The technical prerequisites needed to maintain and use a Bitcoin payment system is the\n",
    "sufficient technical device, described in section 5.2, and an internet connection. The study\n",
    "showed that overall, Sweden has the needed technology to maintain a Bitcoin payment system.\n",

    "minority of the Swedish population does not meet the technical prerequisites as this group\n",
    "lacks the equipment needed to participate. The study focused on Bitcoin but as the technology\n",
    "behind Bitcoin is advanced, the drawn conclusions should apply to any existing cryptocurrency\n",
    "of modern time.\n",
    "What major opportunities and limitations would such a transition entail?\n",
    "The study showed several opportunities as well as limitations with a transition to Bitcoin.\n",
    "Cheaper and more efficient cross border payments, open participation and protection of payer\n",
    "integrity are the most significant strengths of the protocol. Limitations such as scalability\n",
    "problems, high energy consumption and confirmation times of up to an hour, are the most\n",
    "serious limitations of the protocol.\n",
    "The limitations require careful consideration, in order to avoid loss of functionality during a\n",
    "transition to cryptocurrency. One big limitation of Bitcoin is that the confirmation time of a\n",
    "transaction is not compatible with the modern way of conduction in-store commerce. Another\n",
    "factor that might inhibit the further growth of Bitcoin is the required energy consumption to\n",
    "maintain the network. Though it is difficult to make a quantitative comparison between Bitcoin\n",
    "and the traditional payment system in this area, Bitcoin do consume significant amounts of\n",
    "energy and the system is therefore likely to face resistance in this matter.\n",
    "What safety concerns are associated with a transition to a cryptocurrency?\n",
    "The study has exposed two main safety concerns, namely the centralization of the network\n",
    "and the underdeveloped user-system interaction. The security of Bitcoin relies on the\n",
    "decentralized network. Therefore, anything that could affect the decentralization negatively,\n",
    "centralizing the network to larger extent, is considered a safety concern. In addition, most\n",
    "Swedish inhabitants are custom to depending on the payment system without understanding\n",
    "its underlying technology. With Bitcoin however, such an approach could expose the user to\n",
    "financial and integrity risk, since a proper usage requires a certain level of understanding.\n",

    "inappropriate both as a store of value, and for transactional purposes. In order for it to work\n",
    "as a unit of account to express prices of goods and services, pricing of goods and services\n",
    "would have to be very dynamic.\n",
    "Whether a cryptocurrency could serve as an official currency, viewed from a macroeconomic\n",
    "perspective, depends on what school of thought you belong to. Since the money supply of\n",

    "is a matter of opinion.\n",
    "Would a transition to a cryptocurrency, as national currency of Sweden, be possible and what would it imply\n",
    "for the Swedish society?\n",
    "To conclude, and to answer the main objective of this report, it would be technically and\n",
    "theoretically possible to implement a cryptocurrency as a national currency of Sweden.\n",
    "However, it is our belief that it in practice would be difficult. A transition would have\n",
    "consequences on our way of conducting business today. While some areas would experience\n",
    "improvements of a transition, there are obstacles in other areas that must be resolved before\n",

    "proposed in order for a cryptocurrency to be used as a mean of payment by the masses. It is\n",
    "however likely that bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, will continue to be used alongside\n",
    "traditional currencies, especially for cross-border payments and bank-to-bank transfers. This\n",
    "because the underlying technology of Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, offers more time\n",
    "and cost efficient transaction processing than the traditional payment systems in these areas.\n",
    "The technical infrastructure of Bitcoin creates interesting possibilities and we believe that\n",
    "Bitcoin will have a great effect on future payment systems. One possible application is a global\n",
    "payment system where the Bitcoin infrastructure is used for transporting value rather than\n",
    "making direct payments. However, bitcoin as a currency seems useful only to a limited extent\n",
    "as of today. This due to the volatility of the bitcoin exchange rate. Though it is maturing with\n",
    "decreasing fluctuations, we do not think that it will be stable enough to be implemented as a\n",
    "national currency. As bitcoin is a global currency, the exchange rate and its fluctuation are\n",
    "harder to both predict and control. Today bitcoin should rather be regarded as a speculative\n",
    "asset, and as an interesting possibility for the ones that lack trust in the traditional financial\n",
    "system.\n",
    "Common for all cryptocurrencies is the need of improved usability. A national cryptocurrency\n",
    "must be easy to use and to protect from fraud attempts and misuse. Though cryptocurrencies\n",
    "provide open participation, they are only accessible for those with a technical understanding\n",
    "and the sufficient equipment. Before a transition could be initiated, a way to include those with\n",
    "limited technical knowledge must be found. A possible scenario is a national cryptocurrency\n",
    "based on a closed network constituting of trusted nodes. Such a scenario would require a clear\n",
    "owner of the blockchain for security enforcing and rule dictating. Some of the problems that\n",
    "Bitcoin struggles with would be eliminated by such a system. For example, the Proof-of-Work\n",
    "algorithm could be designed in a less energy consuming way and the currency might gain more\n",
    "acceptance by the masses due to the existence of a clear owner and issuer. Further on, a clear owner would implicate that the cryptocurrency would be covered by national laws which\n",
    "strengthens consumer protection and places less responsibility on the user. Though such a\n",
    "system contradicts the core values of Bitcoin, it might be a more realistic solution today.\n",
    "In order to successfully implement, and gain acceptance for, a cryptocurrency we believe that\n",
    "a pronounced issuer must exist. This majorly due to practical reasons, since someone has to\n",
    "drive the development in order to gain acceptance from the masses. A possible and probable\n",
    "issuer is the Swedish Riksbank, who are currently investigating the possibility of issuing their\n",
    "own digital currency, e-krona. The interest and need of a cryptocurrency is established on the\n",
    "market, and numerous parties are currently investigating the possibilities that a cryptocurrency\n",
    "would imply. A nationally accepted cryptocurrency is therefore likely to emerge in the near\n",
    "future, but in what shape remains undetermined. Currently, the cryptocurrency market could\n",
    "be illustrated by a swim race - all participants stand ready at the starting pallets, afraid to dive\n",

This note combines many of these attributes into a single model to conditionally measure the varied nature of Cryptocurrencies. Understanding these properties helps us to evaluate their investability. We fit our model to 224 different Cryptocurrencies in order to determine which of these properties exist.

    "Academic interests in anonymous communications research date back to the early 1980s (Chaum, 1981), and the first digital currency, DigiCash, was launched in 1990 which offered anonymity through cryptographic protocols. Nakamoto (2008) resurrected philosophies of Chaum (1981) with the addition of crowd sourcing and peer-to-peer networking which both avoid centralized control. Today, this has manifested itself into a growing Cryptocurrency community which now includes banks, hedgefunds and even Gov- ernment. The most popular Cryptocurrency and largest by market capitalization is Bitcoin. A $1000 USD investment in Bitcoin in July of 2010 would have returned $81,000,000 just 7 years later (BNC, 2017). Bitcoin, or Cryptocurrencies in general face scrutiny as being speculative (Cheah and Fry, 2015). Conversely, there is evidence to suggest the Cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy and is inefficient (Urquhart, 2016), with properties such as price cluster- ing (Urquhart, 2017). There is however a strong growing network of Bitcoin users and academics who are shedding light on this new technology. In this work, we discuss a large investable sample of Cryptocurrencies, and conditionally measure some important stylized facts.\n",

    "This work is deeply motivated by the unique characteristics found in Cryptocurrency data, which are drawing media and aca- demic attention. The empirical data analysis shows Cryptocur- rencies exhibit long memory, leverage, stochastic volatility and heavy tailedness. We further shed light on a larger scope of the Cryptocurrency universe by expanding our analysis to cover 224 Cryptocurrency indices. Although still in its infancy, we contribute a deeper understanding surrounding Cryptocurrencies for the up- coming regulators, investors and governments to explore further on the topic.\n",

    "## Statistical inference in vector autoregressions with possibly integrated processes\n",
    "Hiro Y. Toda , Taku Yamamotob, 1993\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper shows how we can estimate VAR’s formulated in levels and test general restrictions on the parameter matrices even if the processes may be integrated or cointegrated of an arbitrary order. We can apply a usual lag selection procedure to a possibly integrated or cointegrated VAR since the standard asymptotic theory is valid (as far as the order of integration of the process does not exceed the true lag length of the model). Having determined a lag length k, we then estimate a (k + d,,,)th-order VAR where d,,, is the maximal order of integration that we suspect might occur in the process. The coefficient matrices of the last d,,, lagged vectors in the model are ignored (since these are regarded as zeros), and we can test linear or nonlinear restrictions on the first k coefficient matrices using the standard asymptotic theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector autoregressions (VAR’s) are one of the most heavily used classes of models in applied econometrics. However, Park and Phillips (1989) and Sims, Stock, and Watson (1990) among others have recently shown that the conventional asymptotic theory is, in general, not applicable to hypothesis testing in levels VAR’s if the variables are integrated or cointegrated. If eco- nomic variables were known to be, say, 1(l) (integrated of order 1) with no cointegration, then one could estimate a VAR in first-order differences of the variables so that the conventional asymptotic theory is valid for hypothesis testing in the VAR. Similarly, if the variables were known to be, for example, CI( 1, 1) (cointegrated of order 1, l), then one would specify an error correction model (ECM). But, in most applications, it is not known a priori whether the variables are integrated, cointegrated, or (trend) stationary. Consequently, pretests for a unit root(s) and cointegration in the economic time series (and estimation of the cointegrating vector(s) if there is cointegration) are usually required before estimating the VAR model in which statistical inferences are conducted.\n",
    "Several tests for a unit root(s) in a single time series are available (e.g., Dickey and Fuller, 1979; Fuller, 1976; Pantula, 1989; Phillips, 1987; Phillips and Perron, 1988). Unfortunately, however, the power of these tests are known to be very low against the alternative hypothesis of (trend) stationarity. Tests for cointegration and cointegrating ranks have also been developed (e.g., Johansen, 1988, 1991; Phillips and Ouliaris, 1990; Stock and Watson, 1989). In particular, Johansen’s method is related to the topic of the present paper since it is based on a VAR representation of the time series. Again, however, simulation experiments show that the tests for cointegrating ranks in Johansen-type ECM’s are very sensitive to the values of the nuisance parameters in finite samples and hence not very reliable for sample sizes that are typical for economic time series (e.g., Reimers, 1992; Toda, 1995). These observations imply that the usual strategy that one tests some economic hypothesis conditioned on the estimation of a unit root, a cointegrating rank, and a cointegrating vector(s) may suffer from severe pretest biases.\n",
    "Of course, this kind of problems is something econometricians have to live with if their interests are in the cointegrating relations themselves. In many applications of VAR models, however, the researcher’s interest is not in the existence of unit roots or cointegrating relations themselves, but rather in testing economic hypotheses expressed as restrictions on the coefficients of the model. If that is the case, it is clearly desirable to have a testing procedure which is robust to the integration and cointegration properties of the process so as to avoid the possible pretest biases.\n",
    "A typical example is the test of Granger causality in the VAR framework, where the null hypothesis is formulated as zero restrictions on the coefficients of the lags of a subset of the variables. As Sims, Stock, and Watson (1990, Example 2, Sect. 6) and Toda and Phillips (1993a, Sect. 3) show, the usual Wald test statistic for Granger noncausality based on levels estimation not only has a nonstandard asymptotic distribution but depends on nuisance parameters in general if the process is Z(1) . Mosconi and Giannini (1992) and Toda and Phillips (1993a, Sect. 4) applied Johansen’s (1988, 1991) ECM estimation to the problem of Granger causality tests in Z(1) systems. The former is based on the likelihood ratio (LR) principle and the latter on the Wald principle, but both test procedures require the pretests of cointegrating ranks and those procedures are not very simple to implement. Moreover, a difficulty arises in these approaches since the noncausality hypothesis in ECM’s involves nonlinear restrictions on parameter matrices, and therefore Wald (and presumably LR) tests for Granger noncausality may suffer from size distortions due to rank deficiency that cannot be excluded under the null hypothesis (see Toda and Phillips, 1993a).\n",
    "The present paper proposes a simple way to overcome the problems in hypothesis testing that we encounter when VAR processes may have some unit roots. Our method is applicable whether the VAR’s may be stationary (around a deterministic trend), integrated of an arbitrary order, or cointegrated of an arbitrary order. Consequently, one can test linear or nonlinear restrictions on the coefficients by estimating a levels VAR and applying the Wald criterion, paying little attention to the integration and cointegration properties of the time series data in hand.\n",
    "The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 deals with the general model and provides an intuitive discussion on why our approach guarantees the validity of the conventional asymptotic theory in hypothesis testing based on levels VAR’s even if the processes are nonstationary. In Section 3, for simplicity, we restrict our attention to the model where the variables are at most Z(2), and prove formally the above mentioned result, viz., one can test general restrictions on the parameters of levels VAR’s using the conventional asymptotic theory. In Section 4, we consider the problem of choosing lag lengths of VAR’s with possibly integrated or cointegrated processes. Concluding remarks are made in Section 5, and proofs of the lemmas used in the body of the paper are given in the Appendix.\n",
    "A summary word on notation. We use vet(M) to stack the rows of a matrix M into a column vector. I(d) and CZ(d, b) denote an integrated process of order d ;nd a cointegrated process of order d, b, respectively. We use the symbols ’ 5 ‘, ‘-+ 1and ’ s ’ to signify convergence in probability, convergence in distribu- tion, and equality in distribution, respectively. The inequality ‘ > 0 ’ denotes positive definite when applied to matrices. [x] signifies the integer part of a real number X. All limits given in this paper are taken as the sample size T + XI.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper has shown how we can estimate levels VAR’s and test general restrictions on the parameter matrices even if the processes may be integrated or cointegrated of an arbitrary order; we can apply the usual lag selection proced- ure discussed in Section 4 to a possibly integrated or cointegrated VAR (as far as the order of integration of the process does not exceed the true lag length of the model). Having chosen a lag length k, we then estimate a (k + d,,,)th-order VAR where d,,, is the maximal order of integration that we suspect might occur in the process. The coefficient matrices of the last d,,, lagged vectors in the model are ignored (since these are regarded as zeros), and we can test linear or nonlinear restrictions on the first k coefficient matrices using the standard asymptotic theory.\n",
    "We proposed a simple way to test economic hypotheses expressed as restric- tions on the parameters of VAR models without pretests for a unit root(s) and a cointegrating rank(s). Hypothesis tests such as (5) in levels VAR’s, in general, involve not only nonstandard distributions but also nuisance parameters if the processes are integrated or cointegrated, and critical values for the tests cannot conveniently be tabulated. So the usual way to proceed is formulating equiva- lent ECM’s in which most hypothesis testing can be conducted using the standard asymptotic theory. But this requires pretests of a unit root and cointegrating rank, which one may wish to avoid if the cointegrating relation itself is not one’s interest since those tests are known to have low power. Hence, our simple method of adding extra lags intentionally in the estimation should be very useful in practice.\n",
    "Of course, our approach is inefficient and suffers some loss of power since we intentionally over-fit VAR’s. The relative inefficiency depends on a particular model employed. If, for instance, a VAR system has many variables and the true lag length is one, then the inefficiency caused by adding even one extra lag might be relatively big. On the other hand, if a VAR system has a small number of variables and long lag length as is often the case in practice, then the inefficiency caused by adding a few more lags might be relatively small. If the latter is the case, the pretest biases associated with the unit root and cointegration tests could be much more serious.\n",
    "We emphasize, however, that we are not suggesting that our method should totally replace the conventional hypothesis testing that are conditional on the estimation of unit roots and cointegrating ranks. It should rather be regarded as complementing the pretesting method that may suffer serious biases in some cases.\n",
    "Similarly, though the argument in Sections 2 and 3 is also applicable to Dickey-Fuller-type unit root tests and presumably to Johansen-type tests for cointegration, i’ it is not recommended to apply our method to these problems. Since the limiting distributions for the unit root and cointegration tests (with the correct specification of the lag length) are free of nuisance parameters and the critical values are already known, there is no incentive to introduce the ineffi- ciency by adding an extra lag even though it brings the problem within the scope of the conventional asymptotic theory.\n",
    "Finally, the deterministic trends we considered in this paper are simple polynomials in time. It would be straightforward to extend the analysis so that we can allow for more general deterministic trends such as those considered in Park (1992). Moreover, seasonal dummies may also be incorporated into the model in such a way as Johansen (1991).\n",

    "## Speculative bubbles in Bitcoin markets? An empirical investigation into the fundamental value of Bitcoin\n",
    "Eng-Tuck Cheah, John Fry, 2014\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid its rapidly increasing usage and immense public interest the subject of Bitcoin has raised profound economic and societal issues. In this paper we undertake economic and econometric modelling of Bitcoin prices. As with many asset classes we show that Bitcoin exhibits speculative bubbles. Further, we find empirical evidence that the fundamental price of Bitcoin is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally introduced in 2008 by a group of programmers, under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency or virtual money derived from mathematical cryptography and con- ceived as an alternative to government-backed currencies. It was originally envisaged that its construction and digital ‘‘mining’’ pro- cesses would mean that Bitcoin prices would be relatively stable. However, the fact that Bitcoin prices have recently fallen about 60% from their peak value, allied to similar boom–bust patterns in other digital currencies, raises two key questions of interest. Firstly, does this dramatic boom–bust phase constitute a bubble? Secondly, and more importantly, does Bitcoin have a positive fundamental value? In this paper we provide empirical evidence to address the exis- tence of bubbles in Bitcoin markets and to determine the funda- mental value of Bitcoin. Using methods that originate in physics, but are increasingly becoming part of mainstream finance (see e.g. Bree and Joseph, 2013, Lin et al., 2014), we find that Bitcoin prices contain a substantial speculative bubble component (Dowd, 2014). More importantly, our results show that the fundamental value of Bitcoin is zero.\n",
    "Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency with an esti- mated market capitalisation of $3.3 billion (coinmarketcap.com ac- cessed on Feb 16th 2015) but there are other alternative digital currencies—known as altcoins. These altcoins are also gaining in popularity. Rival altcoins to Bitcoin, such as Ripple and Litecoin, also have significant market capitalisations of $441 m and $66 m respectively. It appears that competition between ever-expanding varieties of altcoins may drive down bitcoin’s market share. How- ever, Bitcoin currently accounts for around 83% of the total es- timated cryptocurrency capitalisation of $3.9 billion. Amid huge public and media interest individuals and organisations have in- creasingly begun to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as valid forms of payment. However, some of this media coverage has been negative—reflecting significant downsides. Bitcoin’s vast pro- liferation and lack of regulation (Grinberg, 2012; Plasaras, 2013) may mean its usage encourages black market activities to flourish and raises cybersecurity issues with both individuals and organisa- tions coming under attack. This includes threats to users from ma- licious software and incidents like the hacking of the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.\n",
    "The academic literature on digital currencies, such as Bit- coin, has only recently begun to emerge (see e.g. Grinberg, 2012, Plasaras, 2013, Maurer et al., 2013) and is dwarfed by a multitude of popular articles and unpublished working papers. There is cur- rently much debate about the appropriate interpretation of Bit- coin (see Section 2). Precious metals like gold and paper notes do not generate a cash flow but retain their value because they can be exchanged for goods and services. Bitcoin’s own digital min- ing processes are intended to replicate the production costs as- sociated with precious metals. In contrast, Bitcoin’s convenience, convertibility and low transaction costs share elements of curren- cies (Frisby, 2014). Much of the academic literature concentrates upon legal aspects and a more comprehensive analysis related to the fundamental value of these cryptocurrencies is needed. Any currency needs to fulfil a number of functions such as unit of ac- count (Dwyer, 2014), means of payments and store of value. Fun- damentally, Bitcoin should represent value. Furthermore, in line with other fiat monies, Bitcoin should command a certain level of confidence among its users. However, recent fluctuations in Bitcoin prices are not suggestive of a constant fundamental value. In fact, Bitcoin prices appear to contain ‘‘a substantial speculative com- ponent’’ (Dowd, 2014) that warrants further investigation. Such volatility potentially undermines the role Bitcoin plays as a unit of account. The speculative component could potentially signify bub- bles (Dale et al., 2005). Therefore, we address the issue of testing for the existence of speculative bubbles in Bitcoin prices. More impor- tantly, we empirically estimate Bitcoin’s fundamental value. Our results may thus have important implications for speculative in- vestors, policymakers and law enforcement agencies alike (Dowd, 2014).\n",
    "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses economic approaches to the evaluation of Bitcoin. Sec- tion 3 introduces a bubble model derived from the theory of com- plex systems in physics. Section 4 discusses empirical results. Section 5 concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid increasing levels of interest and popularisation (see e.g. Frisby, 2014), Bitcoins and other cryptocurrency markets have been under-explored academically. Firstly, as with other asset classes, Bitcoin prices are prone to speculative bubbles. Secondly, the bubble component contained within Bitcoin prices is substan- tial (Dowd, 2014). Thirdly, the fundamental value of Bitcoin is zero. These results therefore reflect wider academic and popular con- cerns about Bitcoin’s long-term viability. Results from this study show that cryptocurrency markets share some stylised empirical facts with other markets—namely a vulnerability to speculative bubbles. Future work will undertake further empirical analyses of cryptocurrency markets and the comparison with findings re- ported for other asset classes appears interesting.\n",

    "## Volatility estimation for Bitcoin: A comparison of GARCH models\n",
    "Paraskevi Katsiampa, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "We explore the optimal conditional heteroskedasticity model with regards to goodness-of-fit to Bitcoin price data. It is found that the best model is the AR-CGARCH model, highlighting the significance of including both a short-run and a long-run component of the conditional variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of Bitcoin has recently received much attention. This can be attributed to its innovative features, simplicity, trans- parency and its increasing popularity (Urquhart, 2016), while since its introduction it has posed great challenges and opportuni- ties for policy makers, economists, entrepreneurs, and consumers (Dyhrberg, 2016b). Bitcoin is probably the most successful – and probably most controversial – virtual currency scheme to date (ECB, 2012 p. 21), representing about 41% of the total estimated cryptocurrency capitalisation at present (coinmarketcap.com ac- cessed on Jun 12th 2017).\n",
    "However, recent fluctuations in Bitcoin prices (see Fig. 1) have resulted in periods of high volatility. In fact, as Bitcoin is mainly used as an asset rather than a currency (Glaser et al., 2014; Baek and Elbeck, 2015; Dyhrberg, 2016a), the Bitcoin market is currently highly speculative, and more volatile and susceptible to specu- lative bubbles than other currencies (Grinberg, 2011; Cheah and Fry, 2015). Bitcoin has therefore a place in the financial markets and in portfolio management (Dyhrberg, 2016a), and examining its volatility is crucial. Moreover, the presence of long memory and persistent volatility (Bariviera et al., 2017) justifies the application of GARCH-type models.\n",
    "Earlier studies have employed various GARCH-type models, such as the linear GARCH (Glaser et al., 2014; Gronwald, 2014), the Threshold GARCH (TGARCH) (Dyhrberg, 2016b; Bouoiyour and Selmi, 2015, 2016; Bouri et al., 2017), the Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) (Dyhrberg, 2016a; Bouoiyour and Selmi, 2015, 2016), and the Component with Multiple Threshold-GARCH (CMT- GARCH) (Bouoiyour and Selmi, 2015, 2016). However, as most of the previous studies of the Bitcoin price volatility have used a single conditional heteroskedasticity model, a question that re- mains unanswered is which conditional heteroskedasticity model can better explain the Bitcoin data. Only the studies of Bouoiyour and Selmi (2015, 2016) considered comparing some of the GARCH- type models. Nevertheless, their sample was split into sub-periods without examining volatility estimation throughout the whole in- terval since the introduction of Bitcoin. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate which conditional heteroskedasticity model can describe the Bitcoin price volatility better over the whole period since its introduction.\n",
    "The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the data and methodology employed. Section 3 discusses empirical results. Section 4 concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptocurrencies are a globally spreading phenomenon that is frequently and also prominently addressed by media, venture capitalists, financial and governmental institutions alike (Glaser et al., 2014). The Bitcoin market in particular has recently seen huge growth. As Bitcoin is mainly used for investment purposes, exam- ining its volatility is of high importance. This paper investigated the ability of several competing GARCH-type models to explain the Bitcoin price volatility. We found evidence that the optimal model in terms of goodness-of-fit to the data is the AR-CGARCH, a result which suggests the importance of having both a short-run and a long-run component of conditional variance.\n",

    "## Heterogeneous beliefs and routes to chaos in a simple asset pricing model\n",
    "William A. Brock!, Cars H. Hommes, 1997\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper investigates the dynamics in a simple present discounted value asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs. Agents choose from a finite set of predictors of future prices of a risky asset and revise their ‘beliefs’ in each period in a boundedly rational way, according to a ‘fitness measure’ such as past realized profits. Price fluctuations are thus driven by an evolutionary dynamics between different expectation schemes (‘rational animal spirits’). Using a mixture of local bifurcation theory and numerical methods, we investigate possible bifurcation routes to complicated asset price dynamics. In particular, we present numerical evidence of strange, chaotic attractors when the intensity of choice to switch prediction strategies is high. ( 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently a number of structural asset pricing models have been introduced, emphasizing the role of heterogeneous beliefs in financial markets, with different groups of traders having different expectations about future prices. In most of these heterogeneous agent models two typical investor types arise. The first type are rational ‘smart money’ traders or fundamentalists, believing that the price of an asset is determined solely by its efficient market hypothesis (EMH) funda- mental value, as given by the present discounted value of the stream of future dividends. The second typical trader type are ‘noise traders’, sometimes called chartists or technical analysts, believing that asset prices are not completely determined by fundamentals, but that they may be predicted by simple technical trading rules, extrapolation of trends and other patterns observed in past prices. An early example of a heterogeneous agent model can be found in Zeeman (1974); more recent examples include Haltiwanger and Waldmann (1985), Frankel and Froot (1988), DeLong et al. (1990), and Dacorogna et al. (1995).\n",
    "An important question in heterogeneous agents modelling is whether ‘irra- tional’ traders can survive in the market, or whether they would loose money and be driven out of the market by rational investors, who would trade against them and drive prices back to fundamentals, as argued, e.g. by Friedman (1953). Recently, DeLong et al. (1990) have shown that in a finite horizon financial market model, a constant fraction of ‘noise traders’ may on average earn a higher expected return than ‘rational’ or ‘smart money’ traders, and may survive in the market with positive probability. In related empirical work, Brock et al. (1992) have shown that simple technical trading strategies applied to the Dow Jones index may outperform several popular EMH stochastic finance models such as the random walk or a (G)ARCH-model. In a series of related papers, Kurz (1994a,b,c) introduces heterogeneous, ‘rational beliefs’, where agents may use the ‘wrong’ probability distribution, but the long-run average statistics of realizations coincide with agents anticipations. Kurz (1994c) intro- duces this concept into asset pricing models, and applies it to explain fluctu- ations in the postwar Dow Jones Index.\n",
    "A number of recent papers have emphasized that heterogenity in beliefs may lead to market instability and complicated dynamics, such as cycles or even chaotic fluctuations, in financial markets (e.g. Chiarella, 1992; Day and Huang, 1990; DeGrauwe et al., 1993; Lux, 1995; Sethi, 1996). In these nonlinear models, asset price fluctuations are caused by an endogenous mechanism relating the fraction or the weights of fundamentalists and chartists to the distance between the fundamental and the actual price. A large fraction or weight of the funda- mentalists tends to stabilize prices, whereas a large fraction of chartists tends to destabilize prices. Asset price fluctuations are caused by the interaction between these stabilizing and destabilizing forces. Brock and Hommes (1997b) give a more detailed discussion of the role of nonlinear dynamics in modelling financial markets.\n",
    "In the related ‘artificial economic life’ literature, financial markets are modelled as an evolutionary system, with an ‘ocean’ of traders using different prediction and trading strategies (e.g. Arthur et al. (1996) or the review of LeBaron (1995)). Most of this work is computationally oriented, since the number of different trader types is usually large and therefore the artificial financial market models are not analytically tractible. Brock (1993, 1995) and Brock and LeBaron (1995) have started to build a theoretical framework and analyze simple versions of these adaptive belief systems. Brock and Hommes (1997a) investigate a simple, demand—supply cobweb type adaptive belief system, with rational versus naive expectations and show how heterogeneous beliefs may lead to market instability and strange attractors, when rational expectations are more costly to obtain than naive expectations. Brock and de Fontnouvelle (1996) investigate an overlapping generations monetary economy with adaptive heterogeneous beliefs and show that different types of bifurcations of the monetary steady state can arise, as the intensity of choice to switch prediction strategies increases. Other work related to this evolutionary ap- proach employs genetic algorithms as a learning and expectation formation device (e.g. Marimon et al., 1989; Arifovich, (1994, 1995); Bullard and Duffy, 1994). Timmermann (1993, 1996) investigates learning dynamics in asset pricing models. Another related work is Krusell and Smith (1996), who investigate the effect of different rules of thumb for savings decisions, which vary in sophistica- tion and effort costs, in a stochastic growth model. See Sargent (1993), Marimon (1997) and Evans and Honkapohja (1997) for extensive surveys of the learning literature.\n",
    "This paper presents a tractible form of evolutionary dynamics which we call, Adaptive Belief Systems, in a simple present discounted value (PDV) asset pricing model. Agents can choose from a finite set of different beliefs or predictors of the future price of a risky asset. Predictor selection is based upon a ‘fitness’ or ‘performance’ measure such as past realized profits. Predictor choice is (boundedly) rational in the sense that, at each date, most agents choose the predictor generating the highest past performance. The paper shows how an increase in the ‘intensity of choice’ to switch predictors can lead to market instability and the emergence of complicated dynamics for asset prices and returns. Keynes already argued that stock prices are not only determined by fundamentals, but in addition market psychology and investors’ animal spirits influence financial markets significantly. In our heterogeneous beliefs asset pricing model, when the intensity of choice to switch predictors is high, asset price fluctuations are indeed characterized by an irregular switching between phases where prices are close to the EMH fundamental, phases of optimism (‘castles in the air’), where traders become excited and extrapolate upward trends, and phases of pessimism, where traders become nervous causing a sharp decline in asset prices. A key feature of our adaptive belief systems is that, this irregular switching is triggered by a rational choice between simple prediction strategies. One may thus say that the market is driven by rational animal spirits.\n",
    "The asset pricing model we use is essentially the same as in Lucas (1978). Under homogeneous, rational expectations and the assumption that the divi- dend process of the risky asset is independently identically distributed (IID), the asset price dynamics is extremely simple: one constant price over time! Our paper shows that, under the hypothesis of heterogeneous expectations among traders the situation changes dramatically, and an extremely rich asset price dynamics emerges, with bifurcation routes to strange attractors, especially if switching to more succesfull strategies becomes more rapid. In nonlinear dynamic models such as our asset pricing model, it is in general impossible to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the periodic and chaotic solutions. Therefore, in applied nonlinear dynamics it is common practice to use a mixture of theoretical and numerical methods to analyze the dynamics. Using local bifurcation theory, we are able to detect the primary and the secondary bifurcations in the routes to complexity in asset price fluctuations. In addition, by using numerical tools, such as phase diagrams, bifurcation diagrams and computation of Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension the occurrence of strange, chaotic attractors is demonstrated.\n",
    "The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present the PDV asset pricing model with heterogeneous, adaptive beliefs. A key parameter in the model is the ‘intensity of choice’, measuring how sensitive the mass of traders is to differences in fitnesses across trading strategies. Section 3 briefly discusses some standard numerical tools for the analysis of nonlinear (discrete time) dynamical systems. Section 4 focusses on the dynamics of equilibrium asset prices with a small number (two, three or four) of simple, linear belief types, such as rational (perfect foresight) agents, fundamentalist, trend extrapo- lators, contrarians and biased traders. This section studies the change in equilib- rium dynamics of asset prices, as parameters of interest such as the choice intensity, b, increase. The purpose of this exercise is to uncover common features such as the character of the primary and secondary generic bifurcations, if any, and possible deviations from fundamentals. Proofs of the results in this section are given in an appendix. Finally, Section 5 concludes and briefly discusses some future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have investigated an asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs, where agents select a predictor from a finite set, based upon their past perfor- mance as measured by realized profits. If all traders would be identical and rational, the model essentially reduces to Lucas (1978) asset pricing model and under the additional assumption that dividends are IID, the asset price dynamics would be extremely simple: one constant price equal to the funda- mental at all dates. In contrast, in a heterogeneous agent financial market, the evolutionary dynamics may lead to persistent deviations from the fundamental price, and highly irregular, chaotic asset price fluctuations, when the intensity of choice to switch prediction strategies becomes high.\n",
    "Several bifurcation routes to complicated asset price fluctuations have been observed, as the intensity of choice to switch predictors increases. The primary bifurcations of the fundamental steady state are closely related to the type of traders that dominate the market, in the following way:\n",
    "1. Trend chasers give rise to a pitchfork bifurcation of the fundamental steady state, in which two additional stable nonfundamental steady states arise, one above and one below the fundamental.\n",
    "2. Contrarians give rise to a period doubling bifurcation to a 2-cycle, with one point above and the other one below the fundamental, with up and down oscillation of prices around the fundamental.\n",
    "3. Opposite biased beliefs lead to a Hopf bifurcation and (quasi-)periodic fluc- tuations around an unstable fundamental steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic features of subsequent bifurcation routes to strange attrac- tors, as the intensity of choice increases, are also closely related to the type of traders present in the market. Trend chasers trigger irregular switching between phases of ‘optimism’, with prices following temporary speculative bubbles grow- ing beyond the EMH fundamental, or ‘pessimism’, with prices falling below the fundamental. Contrarians cause a lot of irregular, up and down fluctuations around the fundamental, whereas opposite biases cause oscillatory fluctuations around the fundamental, even when there are no costs for fundamentalists. Our numerical work also suggests that biases alone do not trigger chaotic asset price fluctuations. Sensitivity to initial states and irregular switching between different phases seems to be triggered by trend extrapolators and contrarians. A mixture of fundamentalists, trend chasers, contrarians and biased beliefs leads to strange attractors exhibiting some stylized, qualitative features observed in financial markets, with an irregular switching between phases of close to the EMH fundamental price fluctuations, phases of optimism with upward trends and phases of pessimism with declining asset prices. A key feature of our heterogen- eous beliefs model is that the irregular fluctuations in asset prices are triggered by a rational choice, based upon realized profits, in prediction strategies (Ra- tional Animal Spirits). In Brock and Hommes (1997b) it has been shown that these rational animal spirits exhibit some quantitative features of asset price fluctuations as well. In particular, the autocorrelation structure of prices and returns in the model is similar to the autocorrelation structure in monthly IBM stock prices and returns.\n",
    "Our asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs is very simple and stylized. In particular, for the case of one risky and one risk-free asset, the equilibrium pricing equation is one dimensional. One may thus question the validity and generality of our results. Do similar results also hold for asset pricing models with more than two assets or even in a general equilibrium framework, with a higher-dimensional equilibrium pricing equation? We cannot answer this question in full generality, but would like to make an important note. In a one-parameter family of higher-dimensional dynamic asset pricing models, there are only a few generic (co-dimension one) bifurcations which can lead to instability of the fundamental steady state. The generic co-dimension one bifurcations are: a saddle node (j\"#1), a pitchfork (j\"#1), a period doubling (j\"!1) or a Hopf bifurcation (complex eigenvalues on the unit circle); see, e.g., Kuznetsov (1995) for a detailed mathematical treatment. We conjecture that also for higher-dimensional asset pricing models, a large fraction of trend chasers typically leads to a pitchfork bifurcation, a large fraction of contrarians to a period doubling bifurcation and a large fraction of opposite biases to a Hopf bifurcation. In addition, possible strange attractors arising in these higher-dimensional versions might bear resemblance to the strange attrac- tors in our simple stylized model. For example, in the presence of trend chasers, one would expect the chaotic asset price fluctuations to be characterized by temporary speculative bubbles at irregular time intervals. We leave it for future work to see whether this conjecture is true.\n",
    "There has been a long debate concerning the question whether irrational, speculative traders would be driven out of the market by rational smart money traders. The results in this paper suggest that, in a heterogeneous, many agent nonlinear world, the answer to this question seems to be not as obvious as one might have guessed.\n",

    "## Can volume predict Bitcoin returns and volatility? A quantiles-based approach\n",
    "Mehmet Balcilara,b,c, Elie Bourid,⁎, Rangan Guptac, David Roubaudb, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior studies on the price formation in the Bitcoin market consider the role of Bitcoin transactions at the conditional mean of the returns distribution. This study employs in contrast a non-parametric causality-in- quantiles test to analyse the causal relation between trading volume and Bitcoin returns and volatility, over the whole of their respective conditional distributions. The nonparametric characteristics of our test control for misspecification due to nonlinearity and structural breaks, two features of our data that cover 19th December 2011 to 25th April 2016. The causality-in-quantiles test reveals that volume can predict returns – except in Bitcoin bear and bull market regimes. This result highlights the importance of modelling nonlinearity and accounting for the tail behaviour when analysing causal relationships between Bitcoin returns and trading volume. We show, however, that volume cannot help predict the volatility of Bitcoin returns at any point of the conditional distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying the relationship between volume and returns is important in generating a better understanding of how market information is transmitted and then embedded in asset prices. It also helps increase the utility of forecasting asset returns and volatility. In times of stress, in particular, it is critical to examine the return-volume relationship to better understand market booms and crashes (Marsh and Wagner, 2000).\n",
    "While the volume–return relationship has been extensively covered for equities (Karpoff, 1987; Li et al., 2016; Todorova and Souček, 2014), bonds (Balduzzi et al., 2001), commodities (Chiarella et al., 2016), interest rates and currency futures (Puri and Philippatos, 2008), and real estate (Tsai, 2014), it remains unexplored for the Bitcoin market. The latter has recently attracted the attention of the media and scholars, given the rising importance of Bitcoins not only as an electronic payment system but also as financial and speculative assets (Kristoufek, 2014).\n",
    "In a speculative market, such as that of Bitcoin, understanding the volume–return paradigm is essential to shedding light on potential implications for trading strategies. Practically, if the transaction volume in the Bitcoin market has a predictive power for its returns, this suggests that practitioners will be able to construct volume-based strategies to increase profits (Chen et al., 2001). This is particularly important given that many traders and practitioners have relied on technical analysis as an alternative tool to study Bitcoin prices, as no reliable, fundamental valuation technique is available to quantify the intrinsic value of Bitcoin. The fact that market technicians employ models and trading rules based on the relation between return and volume further underscores the need for a better understanding of the Bitcoin volume–return relationship.\n",
    "Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has been characterized by sharp upward and downward price movement associated with high transac- tion volumes. On 19 November 2013, the price of Bitcoin on Bitstamp, the largest European Bitcoin exchange, plunged almost 20% (19.88%) on the highest volume ever recorded (71,560 Bitcoins). Furthermore, on 7 December 2013, the Bitcoin price plunged almost 15% (14.92%) and recorded a new all-time trading volume high of 79,852 Bitcoins. Again, on 18 December 2013, Bitcoin price plunged almost 23% (22.80%) and hit a new daily volume record high of 137,070 Bitcoins.1 These trends suggest a strong relationship between the magnitudes of price movement and transaction volume. However, no study thus far to explores this relationship in depth for Bitcoin. To address this research gap, we use the novel, nonparametric causality- in-quantiles test from Balcilar et al. (2016a) to examine the predict- ability of Bitcoin returns and volatility based on trading volume. For our purpose, we use daily data covering the period of 19 December 2011 to 25 April 2016. The nonparametric causality-in-quantiles approach has three main novelties: First, our approach is robust to misspecification errors as it detects the underlying dependence struc- ture across the variables under study. This novelty arises from the view that stock returns are inherently non-linear (see Bekiros et al., 2016, for a detailed discussion in this regard) – a fact we confirm in our data. Second, our methodology allows for the detection of not only the causality-in-mean but also for any potential causality in the tails of the joint distribution of the variables. This novelty is crucial if the dependent variable has proven to have fat-tails – a fact that has been shown to exist for Bitcoin returns (and volume). Third, our nonpara- metric causality-in-quantiles approach allows us to examine causality- in-variance and, thus, study higher-order dependency. Such an in- vestigation is important because during some periods, causality in the conditional-mean may not exist, while, at the same time, higher-order interdependencies may turn out to be significant.\n",
    "Note that we could have also used nonlinear causality tests (for example, Hiemstra and Jones, 1994, and Diks and Panchenko, 2005) and GARCH models to analyse the impact of volume on Bitcoin returns and/or volatility, as used recently by Bampinas and Panagiotidis (2015) while analyzing causality between gold and oil markets. As pointed out by Diks and Panchenko (2005), Himestra-Jones test is generally not compatible with the definition of Granger causality and over-rejects the null of no Granger causality. Diks and Panchenko (2005) rectify the over-rejection problem of the Himestra-Jones test by using the average of local dependence measures. However, these approaches rely on conditional-mean based estimation, and hence, fail to capture the entire conditional distribution of returns and volatility – something we can do with our nonparametric causality-in-quantile approach. Indeed, Bampinas and Panagiotidis (2015) find evidence that mean-based test cannot deal with the time dependent causality linkages due to structural breaks. In the process, our nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test is a more general procedure of detecting causality in both returns and volatility simultaneously at each point of their respective conditional distributions. Hence, we are able to capture existence or non-existence of causality at various states of the Bitcoin market: bear (lower quantiles), normal (median), and bull (upper quantiles). As a more general test, our nonparametric causality-in- quantile approach is more likely to pick up causality when conditional mean-based tests might fail to do so. In addition, since we do not need to decide on the number of regimes as in a Markov-switching model, and can test for causality at each point of the conditional distribution characterising specific regimes, our test also does not suffer from any misspecification in terms of specifying and testing for the optimal number of regimes. An important issue however, is that like standard causality tests, existence of causality would imply that it holds at all horizons. As discussed in Bampinas and Panagiotidis (2015), a more informative causality test would be to use the approach of Hill (2007), which allows us to detect causality in tri-variate system and at multiple horizons and in a time-varying fashion using recursive or rolling windows. While the advantages in terms of multiple-horizons are undeniable, the approach of Hill (2007) remains a conditional mean based approach restricted to only the first-moment.\n",
    "Indeed, certain studies, such as Chuang et al. (2009), Chiang and Li (2012), Gebka and Wohar (2013), Lin (2013), and Chen et al. (2016), have used quantile based methodologies to study the relationship between returns and volatility based on the volume of traditional stock indices of Pacific Basin and Asian countries. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyses the predictability of returns and volatility of Bitcoin based on trading volume using a nonparametric method that covers the entire conditional distribution of returns and volatility, and is free from misspecification due to nonlinearities and structural breaks.\n",
    "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related literature on the finance and economics of Bitcoin. Section 3 presents our methodology, while Section 4 discusses the data and the results. Finally, Section 5 concludes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is an open source software-based online payment system. Its popularity among practitioners and economic actors has soared in response to the perceived failures of governments and central banks during the global financial crisis of 2008 and the European sovereign debt crisis (ESDC) of 2010–2013. While central authorities and central banks guarantee or have control over conventional currencies, Bitcoin is fully decentralized and depends on a sophisticated protocol that uses only cryptography to control transactions, manage its supply, and prevent harmful actions that may endanger the system. All transactions are stored digitally and recorded in a shared ledger data technology known as blockchain. While the algorithm behind Bitcoin represents a solid safeguard against counterfeiting, the system has proved to be vulnerable to illicit activities such as the massive theft of 350 million USD worth of Bitcoins from the Mt. Gox exchange in February 2014. The principles of Bitcoin are explained by Dwyer (2015) and at bitcoin.org. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to come into existence. While other cryptocurrencies, such as Feathercoin and Peercoin, now exist, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its leading position in this particular market.2 At the end of June 2016, Bitcoin market capitalisa- tion exceeded 10 billion USD (coinmarketcap.com), which represents more than 80% of the total market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies on the market.\n",
    "In addition to the early, extensive literature on the technical and legal aspects of Bitcoin, the economics and finance debate on Bitcoin have recently intensified. Kristoufek (2014) argues that Bitcoin repre- sents a unique asset, possessing properties of both a standard financial asset and a speculative one. On the other hand, Popper (2015) considers Bitcoin to be digital gold and Bouri et al. (2017a, 2017b) highlight some valuable characteristics of Bitcoin as an investment. Regardless of whether Bitcoin is a financial or a speculative asset, digital gold, or a commodity, some studies have been interested in the ‘moneyness’ of Bitcoin. Yermack (2013) argues that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value but behaves more like a speculative investment than a currency because its market capitalisation is high compared to the economic transactions it facilitates. The author also concludes that Bitcoin volatility adversely affects its usefulness as a currency. Glaser et al. (2014) find that most of the interest in Bitcoin is due to its ‘asset’ aspect and not its currency aspect. Hanley (2013) also indicates that Bitcoin has no fundamental value to support its pure market valuation against conventional currencies. In contrast, Woo et al. (2013) argue that Bitcoin has some fair value due to its money-like properties. Garcia et al. (2014) and Hayes (2016) show that the cost of producing a Bitcoin via mining adds some fundamental value to Bitcoins.\n",
    "Other studies have examined the price formation in the Bitcoin market. Kristoufek (2013) reports a strong bidirectional causality between the prices of Bitcoin and the search queries for Bitcoin on Google Trends and Wikipedia. Bouoiyour and Selmi (2015) illustrate the significant role of a lagged Google search for the word ‘Bitcoin’ in explaining the Bitcoin price, whereas the velocity of Bitcoin, measured by data transactions, fails to explain the Bitcoin price. Similar results regarding the roles of the two above-mentioned variables (the volume of daily searches for Bitcoin on the Internet and the number of Bitcoin transactions) in explaining the Bitcoin price are reported by Polasik et al. (2015). Within the same research subject, Kristoufek (2014) finds that the trade-exchange ratio plays an essential role in driving Bitcoin price fluctuations in the long run. Bouoiyour et al. (2015) examine the relations between Bitcoin price and transactions proxied by the exchange-trade ratio. The authors find that Bitcoin price Granger causes an exchange-trade ratio in the short- and medium-terms. Like Kristoufek (2014), they find that the increasing use of Bitcoin in the exchange-trade ratio expands Bitcoin's price in the long term. They also show a significant link that runs from the exchange-trade ratio to the Bitcoin price. An interesting paper by Ciaian et al. (2016) focuses on the determinants of Bitcoin price fluctuations. It shows that the total number of unique Bitcoin transactions per day – a demand side variable – has more impact on the Bitcoin price than the number of Bitcoins – a supply side variable.\n",
    "We argue that the above literature presents an incomplete picture of the role of trading volume in predicting the Bitcoin returns because the Bitcoin volume–return relationship at the tails may be different from that near the mean of the return distribution. Furthermore, prior studies have overlooked the dependency between the second moment of Bitcoin returns and trading volume. These issues suggest the appropriateness of using the nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test of Balcilar et al. (2016a) to investigate this further.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a large amount of literature has focused on the role of traded volume in predicting movement in stock returns and volatility (see Gebka and Wohar, 2013, for a detailed literature review), the predictability of traded volume for the returns and volatility in the Bitcoin market remains unexplored. To address this literature gap, we examine daily data covering the period of 19t December 2011 to 25 April 2016, which interestingly show that the Bitcoin returns and volume are non-normally distributed. Methodologically, we employ a novel nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test proposed by Balcilar et al. (2016a). It combines elements of the test for nonlinear causality of k-th order developed by Nishiyama et al. (2011) with the causality- in-quantiles test proposed by Jeong et al. (2012).\n",
    "Our results are summarized as follows: First, the standard linear Granger causality test, which was conducted for comparison purposes, fails to detect any evidence of volume causing returns. Second, the nonlinearity test indicates that returns and their relationship with volume evolve in a nonlinear manner. Additionally, tests of multiple structural breaks show evidence of regime changes in returns and in the equation relating them to volume. Evidence of nonlinearity and structural breaks suggests that the linear Granger causality is mis- specified, thus, leading to unreliable results. Third, the causality-in- quantiles approach, which emerges as a suitable choice given evidence of non-linearity, structural breaks, and fat tails, reveals that the null that volume does not Granger cause returns is rejected at the conventional levels of significance over the quantile range of 0.25 to 0.75 of the conditional distribution of returns. However, we fail to reject the null that volume does not Granger cause volatility over the entire conditional distribution. These results show that volume can predict returns, but not volatility, with causality for returns non- existent in bearish (lower quantiles) and bullish (upper quantiles) phases. Therefore, when the market is functioning around the normal (median) mode, volume can indeed predict returns, thus providing investors in the Bitcoin market with valuable predictive information. However, when the market is performing well or poorly, all that matters for predicting future returns is past values, and thus informa- tion about volume is irrelevant. Generally, our results, via the volume- returns causality in the Bitcoin market, highlight the importance of detecting and modelling nonlinearity when analysing predictability via causal relationships. In the Bitcoin speculative market, our findings involve potential implications for trading strategies. Practically, under normal market conditions, practitioners and traders in the Bitcoin market will benefit from constructing volume-return based strategies to increase their profits. This evidence adds to prior studies that only associate Bitcoin price and transaction measures as well as search queries of Bitcoin on Google Trends and Wikipedia (Kristoufek, 2013; Bouoiyour and Selmi, 2015; Ciaian et al., 2016). However, in the bear and bull phases of the Bitcoin market, practitioners and traders can still rely on technical analysis. Given our reliance on the Bitstamp exchange as the sole source of our data for analysing the predictability of Bitcoin returns and volatility based on traded volume, future research may assess whether our results hold in the context of data originating from other leading Bitcoin exchanges. With our approach being a bivariate approach, it would be interesting to check the robustness of our results for both in- and out-of-sample in a multivariate approach that includes other possible predictors such as the volume of daily searches for Bitcoin on the Internet and the mining cost of Bitcoin.\n",

    "## Bitcoin: Medium of exchange or speculative assets?\n",
    "Dirk G. Baur a,⇑, KiHoon Hong b, Adrian D. Lee, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is defined as digital money within a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network. It is a hybrid between fiat currency and commodity currency without intrinsic value and independent of any government or monetary authority. This paper analyses the question of whether Bitcoin is a medium of exchange or an asset and more specifically, what is its current usage and what usage will prevail in the future given its characteristics. We analyse the statistical properties of Bitcoin and find that it is uncorrelated with traditional asset classes such as stocks, bonds and commodities both in normal times and in periods of financial turmoil. The analysis of transaction data of Bitcoin accounts shows that Bitcoins are mainly used as a speculative investment and not as an alternative currency and med- ium of exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Nakamoto (2008), Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system which allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. This definition suggests that Bitcoin is mainly used as an alternative currency. However, Bitcoin can also be used as an asset and thus would serve a different pur- pose. Whilst a currency can be characterized as a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value, an asset does not generally possess the first two features and can be clearly distinguished from a currency.\n",
    "Potential users of virtual currencies (e.g. Bitcoin) as a medium of exchange may be attracted by its low transaction costs, its peer-to-peer, global and government-free design and the possibility to purchase special goods (e.g. illegal drugs) for which the seller may prefer virtual currency. However, potential users may be ‘‘distracted” if the acceptability of the cur- rency or the confidence in the system is low or if the price of the virtual currency is too volatile. If the virtual currency is also viewed as a (speculative) investment, demand for the asset may contribute to the price volatility of the currency and thus the ‘‘distraction” of potential users. The balance between potential users and investors may ultimately determine the success of the virtual currency as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value.\n",
    "Theoretically, if Bitcoin is mainly used as a currency to pay for goods and services, it will compete with fiat currency such as the US dollar, and thereby influence the value of the fiat currency and ultimately affect monetary policies implemented by a central bank. If, on the other hand, it will mainly be used as an investment, it will compete with a large number of other assets such as government bonds, stocks and commodities and possibly play a minor role. Whether it is currency or an asset, the potential influence on the economy as a whole, depends on the success of Bitcoin or similar alternatives compared to existing currencies and financial assets.\n",
    "To answer the question of whether Bitcoin is a currency or an asset, we analyse Bitcoin’s financial characteristics com- paring them to a large number of different financial assets and investigate the usage of Bitcoins; i.e. are Bitcoins mainly used as an alternative currency to pay for goods and services or are they used as an investment?\n",
    "Our paper differs to previous work on Bitcoin and digital currencies in trying to understand the determinants which make virtual currencies more useful as a currency. Papers on Bitcoin pricing tend to investigate the pricing efficiency of Bitcoin (e.g. Hong, 2016, Urquhart, 2016) or pricing determinants using past information (e.g. Kristoufek, 2015, Li and Wang, 2017). While the efficient pricing of Bitcoin is important in improving Bitcoin’s liquidity, it does not necessarily reduce the speculative element of virtual currencies.\n",
    "We find that Bitcoin is mainly used as a speculative investment despite or due to its high volatility and large returns. Interestingly, Bitcoin returns are essentially uncorrelated with all major asset classes in normal and extreme times which offers large diversification benefits. This low correlation also implies low risk from a macro perspective. For example, if Bit- coins showed bubble-like characteristics (e.g. see Cheah and Fry, 2015), a significant fall in the value of Bitcoins could be an isolated event if the correlation remained at zero and thus no other assets would be affected. If, on the other hand, Bitcoin investments were debt-financed, a significant fall in the value could lead to margin calls and then also affect other assets (e.g. see Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) and Kyle and Xiong (2001).\n",
    "The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides some background into the history of money, currencies, the co- existence of currencies, e.g. dual currency regimes, and Bitcoin. Section 3 presents the empirical analysis of Bitcoin returns and user accounts (wallets) to identify its statistical properties and its usage. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the main findings of the paper and provides concluding remarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is designed as a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system and thus a medium of exchange. It can be defined as synthetic commodity money (Selgin, 2015) sharing features with both commodity monies such as gold and fiat monies such as the US dollar. Whilst commodity money is naturally scarce and has a use other than being a medium of exchange, fiat money is not naturally scarce but issued by a central bank and its main purpose is that of being a medium of exchange. In addition, both types of money can be used as a store of value.\n",
    "Bitcoin is a hybrid of commodity money and fiat money. Bitcoin is scarce by design, i.e. its scarcity is determined by an automatic, deterministic rule fulfilled by competitive mining similar to commodity money (e.g. gold) but it has no ‘‘intrinsic” value similar to fiat money. Another important similarity of Bitcoin with commodity money and most prominently gold is its non-centrality. The absence of counterparty risk for gold is, however, not matched by Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer payment network.\n",
    "When evaluating the potential future use and acceptance of Bitcoin it is important to analyse the growth path of Bitcoin supply. The supply of Bitcoins is perfectly predictable and will continue to increase in decreasing steps until 2040 and remain at the 2040 level ad infinitum. This has strong implications for the value of Bitcoins and the potential deflationary effects it may entail. Since the demand for Bitcoins, in contrast to its supply, is unpredictable both in the near future and beyond 2040, it is difficult to forecast the future value and usage of Bitcoins. However, if the demand increased steadily, the demand would eventually become larger than the supply leading to rising prices of Bitcoin and thus deflationary effects. These built-in deflationary effects make it more likely that Bitcoins will be used as an investment rather than as a medium of exchange.1\n",
    "If virtual currencies evolve as a medium of exchange and become an accepted alternative to fiat currencies, they will open up a new type of dual or multiple currency regime in which fiat and virtual currencies coexist. Historically, there are many examples of dual or multiple currency economies. There have been various commodity currencies as media of exchange including shells, cigarettes, cocoa beans, barley and many others.2 In the middle ages, gold, silver and copper coins were often circulated simultaneously at predefined exchange rates. In the 1800s, commodity-backed monies as well as government-issued fiat currency were circulated. In the US, multiple currencies as media of exchange were common during the 1930s when privately-issued banknotes were used simultaneously with government-backed fiat and commodity-backed currency. More recently, numerous examples of dual currency economies are observed in developing and emerging economies including Liberia, Cuba and many Latin American states. Switzerland is an example of an advanced industrial country where the foreign currency euro is accepted in most parts despite the global acceptance of the Swiss franc.\n",
    "When there are multiple currencies in an economy, Gresham’s law states that any circulating currency consisting of ‘‘good” and ‘‘bad” money (both forms required to be accepted at equal value under legal tender law) quickly becomes dom- inated by the ‘‘bad” money (see Bernholz and Gersbach 1992). This is commonly stated as ‘‘Bad money drives out good”. Here, good money is defined as money that shows little difference between its nominal value and real value. In contrast, Rolnick and Weber (1986) theoretically investigated the possibility that bad money would drive good money to a premium rather than driving it out of circulation entirely. Although Rolnick and Weber (1986) ignored the influence of legal tender legislation which requires people to accept both good and bad money as if they were of equal value, the experiences of dol- larization in countries with weak economies and currencies may be seen as Gresham’s Law operating in its reverse form (see Guidotti and Rodriguez, 1992). Mundell (1998) also explains that in the long-run the reverse of Gresham’s Law holds and that strong or ‘‘good” currencies, such as the US dollar, drive out bad currencies. It remains to be seen if virtual currencies become ‘‘good” currencies or ‘‘bad” currencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper analysed the question of whether the most prominent virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a medium of exchange or a (speculative) investment asset. We find Bitcoin’s return properties are very different from traditional asset classes including currencies and thus offer great diversification benefits both in normal times and times of turmoil. Analysing the Bitcoin pub- lic ledger, we find about a third of Bitcoins are held by investors, particularly users that only receive Bitcoin and never send to others. A minority of users, both in number and Bitcoin balances, appear to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. This suggests that at present Bitcoins are held for investment purposes rather than being used for transactions and thus as a med- ium of exchange.\n",
    "Since the size of Bitcoin investments and transactions can be characterised as small relative to other assets we do not see an immediate risk or even threat for financial or monetary stability. However, if the acceptance of Bitcoin or similar virtual currencies increased significantly on a global level, it could affect the value of major fiat currencies and change the relevance of monetary policy. Given Bitcoin’s global decentralized nature and independence from any central bank or supranational authority, regulatory oversight may be difficult and challenging.\n",

    "## Bitcoin, gold and the dollar – A GARCH volatility analysis\n",
    "Anne Haubo Dyhrberg, 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper explores the financial asset capabilities of bitcoin using GARCH models. The initial model showed several similarities to gold and the dollar indicating hedging capabilities and advantages as a medium of exchange. The asymmetric GARCH showed that bitcoin may be useful in risk management and ideal for risk averse investors in anticipation of negative shocks to the market. Overall bitcoin has a place on the financial markets and in portfolio management as it can be classified as something in between gold and the American dollar on a scale from pure medium of exchange advantages to pure store of value advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The market for virtual currencies has grown immensely since 2008 in terms of the number of new currencies as well as the consumer base and transaction frequency. Taking into account that no virtual currency existed outside of online gaming communities, this development is extraordinary. However the disruption caused in the monetary market poses great challenges and opportunities to policy makers, economists and entrepreneurs. The development also forces stakeholders to challenge the fundamental idea of what abilities money should have. Analysis has to originate with classifying what kind of financial asset bitcoin is, as it will indicate what role it has on the market. This paper focusses on this core question. By classifying bitcoin, one will get a sense of what capabilities it might have in the market for risk man- agement and portfolio analysis. Additionally it will remove some of the widespread mystery surrounding the cryptocurrency. Due to the advantages of bitcoin, legislators and economists have been eager to define what bitcoin is in an economic context. Is it a currency or a commodity? How is it different from cryptographic cash (Chaum, 1983) and other virtual currencies (European Central Bank, 2012)? Glaser et al. (2014) asked this question where they focused on the ability of bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin is fairly liquid as one can exchange any currency for bitcoin at any time, but due to its scarcity it has liquidity limitations like other commodities. Furthermore Bohme et al. (2015) found that transactions could be delayed for up to an hour which greatly diminishes the liquidity possibilities. However, the bitcoin protocol does not restrict transfers due to watch-lists or embargoed countries as the identities of its users are not known. This gives bitcoin an immense flexibility and speed of international transfer compared to other currencies managed by banks. Glaser et al. (2014) found that the majority of users treat their bitcoin investments as speculative assets rather than as a means of payment. Therefore bitcoin may be mostly useful as an asset rather than a currency\n",
    "Generally economists have compared bitcoin to gold as they have many similarities. Gold has some intrinsic value but it most likely does not justify its current market value of approximately 1,200 USD per troy ounce (Datastream). Bitcoin must have some intrinsic value if its users are rational. It unlikely justify its current price of 240.5 USD per bitcoin as of June 2015 (Coindesk, 2015). Both bitcoin and gold derive most of their value from the fact that they are scarce and costly to extract. Neither of them has a nationality or is controlled by a government. Both assets are ‘mined’ by several independent operators and companies. Gold was used as a medium of exchange during the gold standard but was abandoned due to liquidity problems. Similar problems might occur for bitcoin if the user base expands further. However on certain points gold and bitcoin are different. Gold is primarily used for its store of value abilities and for its negative correlation with the American dollar which makes it useful for hedging. Such abilities are not certain for bitcoin but will be investigated.\n",
    "Karl Whelan has also argued that bitcoin is similar to the dollar (Whelan, 2013). They both have no or limited intrinsic value and are used primarily as a medium of exchange. The main difference is that the dollar is backed by a government in which people trust, while bitcoin is a “private money” introduced by the private sector. Therefore the supply, governance and control of the two assets are different but the comparison is interesting as it shows which monetary abilities are observable.\n",
    "As bitcoin is difficult to define, analyzing if it reacts to the same variables as the dollar and the gold price is informative. The GARCH framework can give an indication of what elements of the world econ- omy bitcoin is sensitive to. This analysis will therefore suggest the economic abilities of bitcoin in risk management, portfolio analysis and currency capabilities. Consequently the main focus of this paper is to apply the GARCH framework popular amongst finance and asset research to answer the question:\n",
    "1. How does the return on bitcoin behave compared to the gold price and the dollar-euro exchange rate when analyzing the variance of the assets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially this research will explore if bitcoin behaves like a well-known financial asset or as some- thing in between a commodity and a currency by analyzing several aspects of its price volatility. The results will also suggest if any hedging capabilities are observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis shows that bitcoin has many similarities to both gold and the dollar. Medium of exchange characteristics are clear and bitcoin reacts significantly to the federal funds rate which points to bitcoin acting like a currency. However as bitcoin is both decentralized and largely unregulated it will never be- have exactly like the currencies on the market today. Most aspects of bitcoin are similar to gold as they react to similar variables in the GARCH model, possess similar hedging capabilities and react symmet- rically to good and bad news. However the frequency may be higher for bitcoin as trading is faster and reactions to market sentiment are quick. The overall result suggests that bitcoin is somewhere in between a currency and a commodity due to its decentralized nature and limited market size. However this does not mean that bitcoin is less useful than current assets on the market. On the contrary, this classification suggests that individuals in portfolio management and market analysis can get a more detailed view of the market by including bitcoin which enables them to make more informed decisions and gain another instrument in hedging. Additionally bitcoin can be used as a tool for risk averse investors in anticipa- tion of bad news. Therefore bitcoin’s position on the market would be between gold and the dollar on a scale with one extreme being pure store of value benefits and the other extreme being pure medium of exchange advantages. This result suggests that bitcoin can combine some of the advantages of both com- modities and currencies in the financial markets and therefore be a useful tool for portfolio management, risk analysis and market sentiment analysis.\n",

    "## On the hedge and safe haven properties of Bitcoin: Is it really more than a diversifier?\n",

    "This paper uses a dynamic conditional correlation model to examine whether Bitcoin can act as a hedge and safe haven for major world stock indices, bonds, oil, gold, the general commodity index and the US dollar index. Daily and weekly data span from July 2011 to December 2015. Overall, the empirical results indicate that Bitcoin is a poor hedge and is suitable for diversification purposes only. However, Bitcoin can only serve as a strong safe haven against weekly extreme down movements in Asian stocks. We also show that Bitcoin hedging and safe haven properties vary between horizons.\n",

    "Bitcoin is a digital currency and payment system first introduced by Nakamoto (2008). It is fully decentralized and de- pends on a sophisticated protocol. In this sense, the most unique feature of Bitcoin is that there is no central authority guar- anteeing it or having control over it, as central banks are for conventional currencies. Another unique feature is the fact that the supply of Bitcoin is limited by the design of the protocol. The principles of Bitcoin are explained by Dwyer (2015) and at bitcoin.org.\n",
    "Since its introduction in 2009, the value of Bitcoin grew rapidly to more than US$6 billion at the end of 2015 (coinmarketcap.com). In parallel, there has been a growing interest in research addressing the economics and finance of Bitcoin. Rogojanu and Badea (2014) compare Bitcoin to alternative monetary systems. Brandvold et al. (2015) and\n",
    "Ciaian et al. (2016) focus on price discovery in the Bitcoin market. Bouri et al. (2016) concentrate on the role of trading vol- ume in explaining Bitcoin return and volatility. Balcilar et al. (2016) model the persistence in the volatility of Bitcoin returns. Yermack (2013) argues that Bitcoin appears to behave more like a speculative investment than a currency because its market capitalization is high compared to the economic transactions it facilitates. Although Bitcoin is highly volatile (Molnár et al., 2015), its inclusion into a diversified portfolio is highly profitable (see, among others, Halaburda and Gandal, 2014; Eisl et al., 2015). Bitcoin is an alternative to mainstream currencies and is often even considered as a part of an alternative economy. If some investors lose trust to mainstream currencies or to the entire economy, they might resort to Bitcoin. This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin has sometimes been called digital gold (Popper, 2015). Interestingly, Dyhrberg (2015a) situates the hedging capability of Bitcoin somewhere between gold and the US dollar, later arguing (2015b) that Bitcoin is a hedge against UK equities and the US dollar. However, prior research has so far ignored the potential role of Bitcoin as a safe haven and has failed to differentiate among its diversification, hedging and safe haven properties. This paper addresses this literature gap by assessing to what extent Bitcoin can act as a diversifier, hedge and safe haven against movements in the prices of various assets (stock indices, bonds, oil, gold, the general commodity index and the US dollar index).\n",
    "An asset might be suitable for investment from a risk perspective. If the asset is negatively correlated with another asset, putting them together decreases risk significantly. However, we follow Baur and Lucey (2010) and Ratner and Chiu (2013) and differentiate between a diversifier, a hedge and a safe haven. A diversifier is an asset that has a weak positive correlation with another asset on average. A weak (strong) hedge is an asset that is uncorrelated (negatively corre- lated) with another asset on average. A weak (strong) safe haven is an asset that is uncorrelated (negatively correlated) with another asset on average during times of stress. As gold has been traditionally considered a hedge and a safe haven, these concepts have previously been applied mostly to gold (Baur and Lucey, 2010). Also, they were recently applied to credit default swaps (Ratner and Chiu, 2013).\n",
    "With a more explicit modeling technique, which is based on the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model of Engle (2002), our findings are complementary to those presented by Dyhrberg (2015a, 2015b). Particularly, we provide evi- dence that Bitcoin is an effective diversifier against movements in all the assets under study, whereas it is a safe haven in just few cases. These interesting findings would be helpful for policy makers, investors and Bitcoin users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the growing interest in Bitcoin as a digital asset, the current economics and finance literature is still lacking empirical evidence on its diversification, hedging and safe haven properties against other assets, in particular against major world equities, bonds, oil, gold, the general commodity index and the US dollar index. Using daily and weekly data within a DCC model (Engle, 2002), our main overall results show that Bitcoin can serve as an effective diversifier for most of the cases. Furthermore, in just a few cases, Bitcoin has hedge and safe haven properties that differed between horizons.\n",
    "Despite the importance of our empirical results to market participants, a word of caution is warranted regarding the liquidity of Bitcoin. First, Bitcoin investments are far less liquid than conventional assets, and their accessibility to individual investors can improve a lot with the potential emergence of related funds and financial derivatives. Second, the agitated nature of the sample period under study, during which Bitcoin prices experienced high volatility, may imply that the diver- sification ability of Bitcoin is not constant over time. This opens the door for further studies on the time-varying nature of the diversifier, hedge and safe haven properties of Bitcoin.\n",

    "## The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money \n",
    "By John Maynard Keynes, 1936\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is chiefly addressed to my fellow economists. I hope that it will be intelligible to others. But its main purpose is to deal with difficult questions of theory, and only in the second place with the applications of this theory to practice. For if orthodox economics is at fault, the error is to be found not in the superstructure, which has been erected with great care for logical consistency, but in a lack of clearness and of generality in the pre misses. Thus I cannot achieve my object of persuading economists to re-examine critically certain of their basic assumptions except by a highly abstract argument and also by much controversy. I wish there could have been less of the latter. But I have thought it important, not only to explain my own point of view, but also to show in what respects it departs from the prevailing theory. Those, who are strongly wedded to what I shall call 'the classical theory', will fluctuate, I expect, between a belief that I am quite wrong and a belief that I am saying nothing new. It is for others to determine if either of these or the third alternative is right. My controversial passages are aimed at providing some material for an answer; and I must ask forgiveness If, in the pursuit of sharp distinctions, my controversy is itself too keen. I myself held with conviction for many years the theories which I now attack, and I am not, I think, ignorant of their strong points.\n",
    "The matters at issue are of an importance which cannot be exaggerated. But, if my explanations are right, it is my fellow economists, not the general public, whom I must first convince. At this stage of the argument the general public, though welcome at the debate, are only eavesdroppers at an attempt by an economist to bring to an issue the deep divergences of opinion between fellow economists which have for the time being almost destroyed the practical influence of economic theory, and will, until they are resolved, continue to do so.\n",
    "The relation between this book and my Treatise on Money [JMK vols. v and vi], which I published five years ago, is probably clearer to myself than it will be to others; and what in my own mind is a natural evolution in a line of thought which I have been pursuing for several years, may sometimes strike the reader as a confusing change of view. This difficulty is not made less by certain changes in terminology which I have felt compelled to make. These changes of language I have pointed out in the course of the following pages; but the general relationship between the two books can be expressed briefly as follows. When I began to write my Treatise on Money I was still moving along the traditional lines of regarding the influence of money as something so to speak separate from the general theory of supply and demand. When I finished it, I had made some progress towards pushing monetary theory back to becoming a theory of output as a whole. But my lack of emancipation from preconceived ideas showed itself in what now seems to me to be the outstanding fault of the theoretical parts of that work (namely, Books III and IV), that I failed to deal thoroughly with the effects of changes in the level of output. My so-called 'fundamental equations were an instantaneous picture taken on the assumption of a given output. They attempted to show how, assuming the given output, forces could develop which involved a profit-disequilibrium, and thus required a change in the level of output. But the dynamic development, as distinct from the instantaneous picture, was left incomplete and extremely confused. This book, on the other hand, has evolved into what is primarily a study of the forces which determine changes in the scale of output and employment as a whole; and, whilst it is found that money enters into the economic scheme in an essential and peculiar manner, technical monetary detail falls into the background. A monetary economy, we shall find, is essentially one in which changing views about the future are capable of influencing the quantity of employment and not merely its direction. But our method of\n",
    "3\n",
    "analysing the economic behaviour of the present under the influence of changing ideas about the future is one which depends on the interaction of supply and demand, and is in this way linked up with our fundamental theory of value. We are thus led to a more general theory, which includes the classical theory with which we are familiar, as a special case.\n",
    "The writer of a book such as this, treading along unfamiliar paths, is extremely dependent on criticism and conversation if he is to avoid an undue proportion of mistakes. It is astonishing what foolish things one can temporarily believe if one thinks too long alone, particularly in economics (along with the other moral sciences), where it is often impossible to bring one's ideas to a conclusive test either formal or experimental. In this book, even more perhaps than in writing my Treatise on Money, I have depended on the constant advice and constructive criticism of Mr R.F. Kahn. There is a great deal in this book which would not have taken the shape it has except at his suggestion. I have also had much help from Mrs Joan Robinson, Mr R.G. Hawtrey and Mr R.F. Harrod, who have read the whole of the proof-sheets. The index has been compiled by Mr D. M. Bensusan-Butt of King's College, Cambridge.\n",
    "The composition of this book has been for the author a long struggle of escape, and so must the reading of it be for most readers if the author's assault upon them is to be successful,—a struggle of escape from habitual modes of thought and expression. The ideas which are here expressed so laboriously are extremely simple and should be obvious. The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify, for those brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds.\n",

    "I. The wage is equal to the marginal product of labour\n",
    "That is to say, the wage of an employed person is equal to the value which would be lost if employment were to be reduced by one unit (after deducting any other costs which this reduction of output would avoid); subject, however, to the qualification that the equality may be disturbed, in accordance with certain principles, if competition and markets are imperfect.\n",
    "II. The utility of the wage when a given volume of labour is employed is equal to the marginal disutility of that amount of employment.\n",
    "11\n",
    "That is to say, the real wage of an employed person is that which is just sufficient (in the estimation of the employed persons themselves) to induce the volume of labour actually employed to be forthcoming; subject to the qualification that the equality for each individual unit of labour may be disturbed by combination between employable units analogous to the imperfections of competition which qualify the first postulate. Disutility must be here understood to cover every kind of reason which might lead a man, or a body of men, to withhold their labour rather than accept a wage which had to them a utility below a certain minimum.\n",
    "This postulate is compatible with what may be called 'frictional' unemployment. For a realistic interpretation of it legitimately allows for various inexactnesses of adjustment which stand in the way of continuous full employment: for example, unemployment due to a temporary want of balance between the relative quantities of specialised resources as a result of miscalculation or intermittent demand; or to time-lags consequent on unforeseen changes; or to the fact that the change-over from one employment to another cannot be effected without a certain delay, so that there will always exist in a non-static society a proportion of resources unemployed 'between jobs'. In addition to 'frictional' unemployment, the postulate is also compatible with 'voluntary' unemployment due to the refusal or inability of a unit of labour, as a result of legislation or social practices or of combination for collective bargaining or of slow response to change or of mere human obstinacy, to accept a reward corresponding to the value of the product attributable to its marginal productivity. But these two categories of 'frictional' unemployment and 'voluntary' unemployment are comprehensive. The classical postulates do not admit of the possibility of the third category, which I shall define below as 'involuntary' unemployment.\n",
    "Subject to these qualifications, the volume of employed resources is duly determined, according to the classical theory, by the two postulates. The first gives us the demand schedule for employment, the second gives us the supply schedule; and the amount of employment is fixed at the point where the utility of the marginal product balances the disutility of the marginal employment. It would follow from this that there are only four possible means of increasing employment:\n",
    "(a) An improvement in organisation or in foresight which diminishes 'frictional' unemployment;\n",
    "(b) a decrease in the marginal disutility of labour, as expressed by the real wage for which\n",
    "additional labour is available, so as to diminish 'voluntary' unemployment;\n",
    "(c) an increase in the marginal physical productivity of labour in the wage-goods industries (to use Professor Pigou's convenient term for goods upon the price of which the utility of the money-wage depends);\n",
    "or (d) an increase in the price of non-wage-goods compared with the price of wage-goods, associated with a shift in the expenditure of non-wage-earners from wage-goods to non-wage- goods.\n",
    "This, to the best of my understanding, is the substance of Professor Pigou's Theory of Unemployment—the only detailed account of the classical theory of employment which exists.\n",
    "12\n",
    "\n",
    "II\n",
    "Is it true that the above categories are comprehensive in view of the fact that the population generally is seldom doing as much work as it would like to do on the basis of the current wage? For, admittedly, more labour would, as a rule, be forthcoming at the existing money-wage if it were demanded. The classical school reconcile this phenomenon with their second postulate by arguing that, while the demand for labour at the existing money-wage may be satisfied before everyone willing to work at this wage is employed, this situation is due to an open or tacit agreement amongst workers not to work for less, and that if labour as a whole would agree to a reduction of money- wages more employment would be forthcoming. If this is the case, such unemployment, though apparently involuntary, is not strictly so, and ought to be included under the above category of 'voluntary' unemployment due to the effects of collective bargaining, etc.\n",
    "This calls for two observations, the first of which relates to the actual attitude of workers towards real wages and money-wages respectively and is not theoretically fundamental, but the second of which is fundamental.\n",
    "Let us assume, for the moment, that labour is not prepared to work for a lower money-wage and that a reduction in the existing level of money-wages would lead, through strikes or otherwise, to a withdrawal from the labour market of labour which is now employed. Does it follow from this that the existing level of real wages accurately measures the marginal disutility of labour? Not necessarily. For, although a reduction in the existing money-wage would lead to a withdrawal of labour, it does not follow that a fall in the value of the existing money-wage in terms of wage-goods would do so, if it were due to a rise in the price of the latter. In other words, it may be the case that within a certain range the demand of labour is for a minimum money-wage and not for a minimum real wage. The classical school have tacitly assumed that this would involve no significant change in their theory. But this is not so. For if the supply of labour is not a function of real wages as its sole variable, their argument breaks down entirely and leaves the question of what the actual employment will be quite indeterminate. They do not seem to have realised that, unless the supply of labour is a function of real wages alone, their supply curve for labour will shift bodily with every movement of prices. Thus their method is tied up with their very special assumptions, and cannot be adapted to deal with the more general case.\n",
    "Now ordinary experience tells us, beyond doubt, that a situation where labour stipulates (within limits) for a money-wage rather than a real wage, so far from being a mere possibility, is the normal case. Whilst workers will usually resist a reduction of money-wages, it is not their practice to withdraw their labour whenever there is a rise in the price of wage-goods. It is sometimes said that it would be illogical for labour to resist a reduction of money-wages but not to resist a reduction of real wages. For reasons given below (p. 14), this might not be so illogical as it appears at first; and, as we shall see later, fortunately so. But, whether logical or illogical, experience shows that this is how labour in fact behaves.\n",
    "Moreover, the contention that the unemployment which characterises a depression is due to a refusal by labour to accept a reduction of money-wages is not clearly supported by the facts. It is not very plausible to assert that unemployment in the United States in 1932 was due either to labour obstinately refusing to accept a reduction of money-wages or to its obstinately demanding a real wage beyond what the productivity of the economic machine was capable of furnishing. Wide\n",
    "13\n",
    "\n",
    "variations are experienced in the volume of employment without any apparent change either in the minimum real demands of labour or in its productivity. Labour is not more truculent in the depression than in the boom—far from it. Nor is its physical productivity less. These facts from experience are a prima facie ground for questioning the adequacy of the classical analysis.\n",
    "It would be interesting to see the results of a statistical enquiry into the actual relationship between changes in money-wages and changes in real wages. In the case of a change peculiar to a particular industry one would expect the change in real wages to be in the same direction as the change in money-wages. But in the case of changes in the general level of wages, it will be found, I think, that the change in real wages associated with a change in money-wages, so far from being usually in the same direction, is almost always in the opposite direction. When money-wages are rising, that is to say, it will be found that real wages are falling; and when money-wages are falling, real wages are rising. This is because, in the short period, falling money-wages and rising real wages are each, for independent reasons, likely to accompany decreasing employment; labour being readier to accept wage-cuts when employment is falling off, yet real wages inevitably rising in the same circumstances on account of the increasing marginal return to a given capital equipment when output is diminished.\n",
    "If, indeed, it were true that the existing real wage is a minimum below which more labour than is now employed will not be forthcoming in any circumstances, involuntary unemployment, apart from frictional unemployment, would be non-existent. But to suppose that this is invariably the case would be absurd. For more labour than is at present employed is usually available at the existing money-wage, even though the price of wage-goods is rising and, consequently, the real wage falling. If this is true, the wage-goods equivalent of the existing money-wage is not an accurate indication of the marginal disutility of labour, and the second postulate does not hold good.\n",
    "But there is a more fundamental objection. The second postulate flows from the idea that the real wages of labour depend on the wage bargains which labour makes with the entrepreneurs. It is admitted, of course, that the bargains are actually made in terms of money, and even that the real wages acceptable to labour are not altogether independent of what the corresponding money-wage happens to be. Nevertheless it is the money-wage thus arrived at which is held to determine the real wage. Thus the classical theory assumes that it is always open to labour to reduce its real wage by accepting a reduction in its money-wage. The postulate that there is a tendency for the real wage to come to equality with the marginal disutility of labour clearly presumes that labour itself is in a position to decide the real wage for which it works, though not the quantity of employment forthcoming at this wage.\n",
    "The traditional theory maintains, in short, that the wage bargains between the entrepreneurs and the workers determine the real wage; so that, assuming free competition amongst employers and no restrictive combination amongst workers, the latter can, if they wish, bring their real wages into conformity with the marginal disutility of the amount of employment offered by the employers at that wage. If this is not true, then there is no longer any reason to expect a tendency towards equality between the real wage and the marginal disutility of labour.\n",
    "The classical conclusions are intended, it must be remembered, to apply to the whole body of labour and do not mean merely that a single individual can get employment by accepting a cut in money- wages which his fellows refuse. They are supposed to be equally applicable to a closed system as to\n",
    "14\n",
    "\n",
    "an open system, and are not dependent on the characteristics of an open system or on the effects of a reduction of money-wages in a single country on its foreign trade, which lie, of course, entirely outside the field of this discussion. Nor are they based on indirect effects due to a lower wages-bill in terms of money having certain reactions on the banking system and the state of credit, effects which we shall examine in detail in chapter 19. They are based on the belief that in a closed system a reduction in the general level of money-wages will be accompanied, at any rate in the short period and subject only to minor qualifications, by some, though not always a proportionate, reduction in real wages.\n",
    "Now the assumption that the general level of real wages depends on the money-wage bargains between the employers and the workers is not obviously true. Indeed it is strange that so little attempt should have been made to prove or to refute it. For it is far from being consistent with the general tenor of the classical theory, which has taught us to believe that prices are governed by marginal prime cost in terms of money and that money-wages largely govern marginal prime cost. Thus if money-wages change, one would have expected the classical school to argue that prices would change in almost the same proportion, leaving the real wage and the level of unemployment practically the same as before, any small gain or loss to labour being at the expense or profit of other elements of marginal cost which have been left unaltered. They seem, however, to have been diverted from this line of thought, partly by the settled conviction that labour is in a position to determine its own real wage and partly, perhaps, by preoccupation with the idea that prices depend on the quantity of money. And the belief in the proposition that labour is always in a position to determine its own real wage, once adopted, has been ina~ntained by its being confused with the proposition that labour is always in a position to determine what real wage shall correspond to full employment, i.e. the maximum quantity of employment which is compatible with a given real wage.\n",
    "To sum up: there are two objections to the second postulate of the classical theory. The first relates to the actual behaviour of labour. A fall in real wages due to a rise in prices, with money-wages unaltered, does not, as a rule, cause the supply of available labour on offer at the current wage to fall below the amount actually employed prior to the rise of prices. To sthat it does is to suppose that all those who are now unemployed though willing to work at the current wage will withdraw the offer of their labour in the event of even a small rise in the cost of living. Yet this strange supposition apparently underlies Professor Pigou's Theory of Unemployment, and it is what all members of the orthodox school are tacitly assuming.\n",
    "But the other, more fundamental, objection, which we shall develop in the ensuing chapters, flows from our disputing the assumption that the general level of real wages is directly determined by the character of the wage bargain. In assuming that the wage bargain determines the real wage the classical school have slipt in an illicit assumption. For there may be no method available to labour as a whole whereby it can bring the wage-goods equivalent of the general level of money wages into conformity with the marginal disutility of the current volume of employment. There may exist no expedient by which labour as a whole can reduce its real wage to a given figure by making revised money bargains with the entrepreneurs. This will be our contention. We shall endeavour to show that primarily it is certain other forces which determine the general level of real wages. The attempt to elucidate this problem will be one of our main themes. We shall argue that there has been a fundamental misunderstanding of how in this respect the economy in which we live actually works.\n",
    "15\n",
    "\n",
    "III\n",
    "Though the struggle over money-wages between individuals and groups is often believed to determine the general level of real-wages, it is, in fact, concerned with a different object. Since there is imperfect mobility of labour, and wages do not tend to an exact equality of net advantage in different occupations, any individual or group of individuals, who consent to a reduction of money- wages relatively to others, will suffer a relative reduction in real wages, which is a sufficient justification for them to resist it. On the other hand it would be impracticable to resist every reduction of real wages, due to a change in the purchasing-power of money which affects all workers alike; and in fact reductions of real wages arising in this way are not, as a rule, resisted unless they proceed to an extreme degree. Moreover, a resistance to reductions in money-wages applying to particular industries does not raise the same insuperable bar to an increase in aggregate employment which would result from a similar resistance to every reduction in real wages.\n",
    "In other words, the struggle about money-wages primarily affects the distribution of the aggregate real wage between different labour-groups, and not its average amount per unit of employment, which depends, as we shall see, on a different set of forces. The effect of combination on the part of a group of workers is to protect their relative real wage. The general level of real wages depends on the other forces of the economic system.\n",
    "Thus it is fortunate that the workers, though unconsciously, are instinctively more reasonable economists than the classical school, inasmuch as they resist reductions of money-wages, which are seldom or never of an all-round character, even though the existing real equivalent of these wages exceeds the marginal disutility of the existing employment; whereas they do not resist reductions of real wages, which are associated with increases in aggregate employment and leave relative money- wages unchanged, unless the reduction proceeds so far as to threaten a reduction of the real wage below the marginal disutility of the existing volume of employment. Every trade union will put up some resistance to a cut in money-wages, however small. But since no trade union would dream of striking on every occasion of a rise in the cost of living, they do not raise the obstacle to any increase in aggregate employment which is attributed to them by the classical school.\n",
    "IV\n",
    "We must now define the third category of unemployment, namely 'involuntary' unemployment in the strict sense, the possibility of which the classical theory does not admit.\n",
    "Clearly we do not mean by 'involuntary' unemployment the mere existence of an unexhausted capacity to work. An eight-hour day does not constitute unemployment because it is not beyond human capacity to work ten hours. Nor should we regard as 'involuntary' unemployment the withdrawal of their labour by a body of workers because they do not choose to work for less than a certain real reward. Furthermore, it will be convenient to exclude 'frictional' unemployment from our definition of 'involuntary' unemployment. My definition is, therefore, as follows: Men are involuntarily unemployed If, in the event of a small rise in the price of wage-goods relatively to the money-wage, both the aggregate supply of labour willing to work for the current money-wage and the aggregate demand for it at that wage would be greater than the existing volume of employment.\n",
    "16\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative definition, which amounts, however, to the same thing, will be given in the next chapter.\n",
    "It follows from this definition that the equality of the real wage to the marginal disutility of employment presupposed by the second postulate, realistically interpreted, corresponds to the absence of 'involuntary' unemployment. This state of affairs we shall describe as 'full' employment, both 'frictional' and 'voluntary' unemployment being consistent with 'full' employment thus defined. This fits in, we shall find, with other characteristics of the classical theory, which is best regarded as a theory of distribution in conditions of full employment. So long as the classical postulates hold good, unemployment, which is in the above sense involuntary, cannot occur. Apparent unemployment must, therefore, be the result either of temporary loss of work of the 'between jobs' type or of intermittent demand for highly specialised resources or of the effect of a trade union 'closed shop' on the employment of free labour. Thus writers in the classical tradition, overlooking the special assumption underlying their theory, have been driven inevitably to the conclusion, perfectly logical on their assumption, that apparent unemployment (apart from the admitted exceptions) must be due at bottom to a refusal by the unemployed factors to accept a reward which corresponds to their marginal productivity. A classical economist may sympathise with labour in refusing to accept a cut in its money-wage, and he will admit that it may not be wise to make it to meet conditions which are temporary; but scientific integrity forces him to declare that this refusal is, nevertheless, at the bottom of the trouble.\n",
    "Obviously, however, if the classical theory is only applicable to the case of full employment, it is fallacious to apply it to the problems of involuntary unemployment—if there be such a thing (and who will deny it?). The classical theorists resemble Euclidean geometers in a non-Euclidean world who, discovering that in experience straight lines apparently parallel often meet, rebuke the lines for not keeping straight—as the only remedy for the unfortunate collisions which are occurring. Yet, in truth, there is no remedy except to throw over the axiom of parallels and to work out a non- Euclidean geometry. Something similar is required to-day in economics. We need to throw over the second postulate of the classical doctrine and to work out the behaviour of a system in which involuntary unemployment in the strict sense is possible.\n",
    "V\n",
    "In emphasising our point of departure from the classical system, we must not overlook an important point of agreement. For we shall maintain the first postulate as heretofore, subject only to the same qualifications as in the classical theory; and we must pause, for a moment, to consider what this involves.\n",
    "It means that, with a given organisation, equipment and technique, real wages and the volume of output (and hence of employment) are uniquely correlated, so that, in general, an increase in employment can only occur to the accompaniment of a decline in the rate of real wages. Thus I am not disputing this vital fact which the classical economists have (rightly) asserted as indefeasible. In a given state of organisation, equipment and technique, the real wage earned by a unit of labour has a unique (inverse) correlation with the volume of employment. Thus if employment increases, then, in the short period, the reward per unit of labour in terms of wage-goods must, in general, decline and profits increase. This is simply the obverse of the familiar proposition that industry is normally working subject to decreasing returns in the short period during which equipment etc. is assumed to\n",
    "17\n",
    "\n",
    "be constant; so that the marginal product in the wage-good industries (which governs real wages) necessarily diminishes as employment is increased. So long, indeed, as this proposition holds, any means of increasing employment must lead at the same time to a diminution of the marginal product and hence of the rate of wages measured in terms of this product.\n",
    "But when we have thrown over the second postulate, a decline in employment, although necessarily associated with labour's receiving a wage equal in value to a larger quantity of wage-goods, is not necessarily due to labour's demanding a larger quantity of wage-goods; and a willingness on the part of labour to accept lower money-wages is not necessarily a remedy for unemployment. The theory of wages in relation to employment, to which we are here leading up, cannot be fully elucidated, however, until chapter 19 and its Appendix have been reached.\n",
    "VI\n",
    "From the time of Say and Ricardo the classical economists have taught that supply creates its own demand;—meaning by this in some significant, but not clearly defined, sense that the whole of the costs of production must necessarily be spent in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, on purchasing the product.\n",
    "In J.S. Mill's Principles of Political Economy the doctrine is expressly set forth:\n",
    "What constitutes the means of payment for commodities is simply commodities. Each person's means of paying for the productions of other people consist of those which he himself possesses. All sellers are inevitably, and by the meaning of the word, buyers. Could we suddenly double the productive powers of the country, we should double the supply of commodities in every market; but we should, by the same stroke, double the purchasing power. Everybody would bring a double demand as well as supply; everybody would be able to buy twice as much, because every one would have twice as much to offer in exchange.\n",
    "As a corollary of the same doctrine, it has been supposed that any individual act of abstaining from consumption necessarily leads to, and amounts to the same thing as, causing the labour and commodities thus released from supplying consumption to be invested in the production of capital wealth. The following passage from Marshall's Pure Theory of Domestic Values illustrates the traditional approach:\n",
    "The whole of a man's income is expended in the purchase of services and of commodities. It is indeed commonly said that a man spends some portion of his income and saves another. But it is a familiar economic axiom that a man purchases labour and commodities with that portion of his income which he saves just as much as he does with that he is said to spend. He is said to spend when he seeks to obtain present enjoyment from the services and commodities which he purchases. He is said to save when he causes the labour and the commodities which he purchases to be devoted to the production of wealth from which he expects to derive the means of enjoyment in the future.\n",
    "It is true that it would not be easy to quote comparable passages from Marshall's later work or from Edgeworth or Professor Pigou. The doctrine is never stated to-day in this crude form. Nevertheless it still underlies the whole classical theory, which would collapse without it. Contemporary economists, who might hesitate to agree with Mill, do not hesitate to accept conclusions which\n",
    "18\n",
    "\n",
    "require Mill's doctrine as their premiss. The conviction, which runs, for example, through almost all Professor Pigou's work, that money makes no real difference except frictionally and that the theory of production and employment can be worked out (like Mill's) as being based on 'real' exchanges with money introduced perfunctorily in a later chapter, is the modern version of the classical tradition. Contemporary thought is still deeply steeped in the notion that if people do not spend their money in one way they will spend it in another. Post-war economists seldom, indeed, succeed in maintaining this standpoint consistently; for their thought to-day is too much permeated with the contrary tendency and with facts of experience too obviously inconsistent with their former view. But they have not drawn sufficiently far-reaching consequences; and have not revised their fundamental theory.\n",
    "In the first instance, these conclusions may have been applied to the kind of economy in which we actually live by false analogy from some kind of non-exchange Robinson Crusoe economy, in which the income which individuals consume or retain as a result of their productive activity is, actually and exclusively, the output in specie of that activity. But, apart from this, the conclusion that the costs of output are always covered in the aggregate by the sale-proceeds resulting from demand, has great plausibility, because it is difficult to distinguish it from another, similar-looking proposition which is indubitable, namely that the income derived in the aggregate by all the elements in the community concerned in a productive activity necessarily has a value exactly equal to the value of the output.\n",
    "Similarly it is natural to suppose that the act of an individual, by which he enriches himself without apparently taking anything from anyone else, must also enrich the community as a whole; so that (as in the passage just quoted from Marshall) an act of individual saving inevitably leads to a parallel act of investment. For, once more, it is indubitable that the sum of the net increments of the wealth of individuals must be exactly equal to the aggregate net increment of the wealth of the community.\n",
    "Those who think in this way are deceived, nevertheless, by an optical illusion, which makes two essentially different activities appear to be the same. They are fallaciously supposing that there is a nexus which unites decisions to abstain from present consumption with decisions to provide for future consumption; whereas the motives which determine the latter are not linked in any simple way with the motives which determine the former.\n",
    "It is, then, the assumption of equality between the demand price of output as a whole and its supply price which is to be regarded as the classical theory's 'axiom of parallels'. Granted this, all the rest follows—the social advantages of private and national thrift, the traditional attitude towards the rate of interest, the classical theory of unemployment, the quantity theory of money, the unqualified advantages of laissez-faire in respect of foreign trade and much else which we shall have to question.\n",

    "THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE DEMAND I\n",
    "We need, to start with, a few terms which will be defined precisely later. In a given state of technique, resources and costs, the employment of a given volume of labour by an entrepreneur involves him in two kinds of expense: first of all, the amounts which he pays out to the factors of production (exclusive of other entrepreneurs) for their current services, which we shall call the factor cost of the employment in question; and secondly, the amounts which he pays out to other entrepreneurs for what he has to purchase from them together with the sacrifice which he incurs by employing the equipment instead of leaving it idle, which we shall call the user cost of the employment in question. The excess of the value of the resulting output over the sum of its factor cost and its user cost is the profit or, as we shall call it, the income of the entrepreneur. The factor cost is, of course, the same thing, looked at from the point of view of the entrepreneur, as what the factors of production regard as their income. Thus the factor cost and the entrepreneur's profit make up, between them, what we shall define as the total income resulting from the employment given by the entrepreneur. The entrepreneur's profit thus defined is, as it should be, the quantity which he endeavours to maximise when he is deciding what amount of employment to offer. It is sometimes convenient, when we are looking at it from the entrepreneur's standpoint, to call the aggregate income (i.e. factor cost plus profit) resulting from a given amount of employment the proceeds of that employment. On the other hand, the aggregate supply price of the output of a given amount of employment is the expectation of proceeds which will just make it worth the while of the entrepreneurs to give that employment.\n",
    "It follows that in a given situation of technique, resources and factor cost per unit of employment, the amount of employment, both in each individual firm and industry and in the aggregate, depends on the amount of the proceeds which the entrepreneurs expect to receive from the corresponding output. For entrepreneurs will endeavour to fix the amount of employment at the level which they expect to maximise the excess of the proceeds over the factor cost.\n",
    "Let Z be the aggregate supply price of the output from employing N men, the relationship between Z and N being written Z = φ(N), which can be called the aggregate supply function. Similarly, let D be the proceeds which entrepreneurs expect to receive from the employment of N men, the relationship between D and N being written D = f(N), which can be called the aggregate demand function.\n",
    "Now if for a given value of N the expected proceeds are greater than the aggregate supply price, i.e. if D is greater than Z, there will be an incentive to entrepreneurs to increase employment beyond N 20\n",
    "and, if necessary, to raise costs by competing with one another for the factors of production, up to the value of N for which Z has become equal to D. Thus the volume of employment is given by the point of intersection between the aggregate demand function and the aggregate supply function; for it is at this point that the entrepreneurs' expectation of profits will be maximised. The value of D at the point of the aggregate demand function, where it is intersected by the aggregate supply function, will be called the effective demand. Since this is the substance of the General Theory of Employment, which it will be our object to expound, the succeeding chapters will be largely occupied with examining the various factors upon which these two functions depend.\n",
    "The classical doctrine, on the other hand, which used to be expressed categorically in the statement that 'Supply creates its own Demand' and continues to underlie all orthodox economic theory, involves a special assumption as to the relationship between these two functions. For 'Supply creates its own Demand' must mean that f(N) and φ(N) are equal for all values of N, i.e. for all levels of output and employment; and that when there is an increase in Z ( = φ(N)) corresponding to an increase in N, D ( = f(N)) necessarily increases by the same amount as Z. The classical theory assumes, in other words, that the aggregate demand price (or proceeds) always accommodates itself to the aggregate supply price; so that, whatever the value of N may be, the proceeds D assume a value equal to the aggregate supply price Z which corresponds to N. That is to say, effective demand, instead of having a unique equilibrium value, is an infinite range of values all equally admissible; and the amount of employment is indeterminate except in so far as the marginal disutility of labour sets an upper limit.\n",
    "If this were true, competition between entrepreneurs would always lead to an expansion of employment up to the point at which the supply of output as a whole ceases to be elastic, i.e. where a further increase in the value of the effective demand will no longer be accompanied by any increase in output. Evidently this amounts to the same thing as full employment. In the previous chapter we have given a definition of full employment in terms of the behaviour of labour. An alternative, though equivalent, criterion is that at which we have now arrived, namely a situation in which aggregate employment is inelastic in response to an increase in the effective demand for its output. Thus Say's law, that the aggregate demand price of output as a whole is equal to its aggregate supply price for all volumes of output, is equivalent to the proposition that there is no obstacle to full employment. If, however, this is not the true law relating the aggregate demand and supply functions, there is a vitally important chapter of economic theory which remains to be written and without which all discussions concerning the volume of aggregate employment are futile.\n",
    "II\n",
    "A brief summary of the theory of employment to be worked out in the course of the following chapters may, perhaps, help the reader at this stage, even though it may not be fully intelligible. The terms involved will be more carefully defined in due course. In this summary we shall assume that the money-wage and other factor costs are constant per unit of labour employed. But this simplification, with which we shall dispense later, is introduced solely to facilitate the exposition. The essential character of the argument is precisely the same whether or not money-wages, etc., are liable to change.\n",
    "21\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of our theory can be expressed as follows. When employment increases, aggregate real income is increased. The psychology of the community is such that when aggregate real income is increased aggregate consumption is increased, but not by so much as income. Hence employers would make a loss if the whole of the increased employment were to be devoted to satisfying the increased demand for immediate consumption. Thus, to justify any given amount of employment there must be an amount of current investment sufficient to absorb the excess of total output over what the community chooses to consume when employment is at the given level. For unless there is this amount of investment, the receipts of the entrepreneurs will be less than is required to induce them to offer the given amount of employment. It follows, therefore, that, given what we shall call the community's propensity to consume, the equilibrium level of employment, i.e. the level at which there is no inducement to employers as a whole either to expand or to contract employment, will depend on the amount of current investment. The amount of current investment will depend, in turn, on what we shall call the inducement to invest; and the inducement to invest will be found to depend on the relation between the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital and the complex of rates of interest on loans of various maturities and risks.\n",
    "Thus, given the propensity to consume and the rate of new investment, there will be only one level of employment consistent with equilibrium; since any other level will lead to inequality between the aggregate supply price of output as a whole and its aggregate demand price. This level cannot be greater than full employment, i.e. the real wage cannot be less than the marginal disutility of labour. But there is no reason in general for expecting it to be equal to full employment. The effective demand associated with full employment is a special case, only realised when the propensity to consume and the inducement to invest stand in a particular relationship to one another. This particular relationship, which corresponds to the assumptions of the classical theory, is in a sense an optimum relationship. But it can only exist when, by accident or design, current investment provides an amount of demand just equal to the excess of the aggregate supply price of the output resulting from full employment over what the community will choose to spend on consurnption when it is fully employed.\n",
    "This theory can be summed up in the following propositions:\n",
    "(1) In a given situation of technique, resources and costs, income (both money-income and real\n",
    "income) depends on the volume of employment N.\n",
    "(2) The relationship between the community's income and what it can be expected to spend on consumption, designated by D1, will depend on the psychological characteristic of the community, which we shall call its propensity to consume. That is to say, consumption will depend on the level of aggregate income and, therefore, on the level of employment N, except when there is some change in the propensity to consume.\n",
    "(3) The amount of labour N which the entrepreneurs decide to employ depends on the sum (D) of two quantities, namely D1, the amount which the community is expected to spend on consumption, and D2, the amount which it is expected to devote to new investment. D is what we have called above the effective demand.\n",
    "22\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Since D1 + D2 = D = φ(N), where is the aggregate supply function, and since, as we have seen in (2) above, D1 is a function of N, which we may write χ(N), depending on the propensity to consume, it follows that φ(N) − χ(N) = D2.\n",
    "(5) Hence the volume of employment in equilibrium depends on (i) the aggregate supply function, (ii) the propensity to consume, and (iii) the volume of investment, D2. This is the essence of the General Theory of Employment.\n",
    "(6) For every value of N there is a corresponding marginal productivity of labour in the wage-goods industries; and it is this which determines the real wage. (5) is, therefore, subject to the condition that N cannot exceed the value which reduces the real wage to equality with the marginal disutility of labour. This means that not all changes in D are compatible with our temporary assumption that money-wages are constant. Thus it will be essential to a full statement of our theory to dispense with this assumption.\n",
    "(7) On the classical theory, according to which D = φ(N) for all values of N, the volume of employment is in neutral equilibrium for all values of N less than its maximum value; so that the forces of competition between entrepreneurs may be expected to push it to this maximum value. Only at this point, on the classical theory, can there be stable equilibrium.\n",
    "(8) When employment increases, D1will increase, but not by so much as D; since when our income increases our consumption increases also, but not by so much. The key to our practical problem is to be found in this psychological law. For it follows from this that the greater the volume of employment the greater will be the gap between the aggregate supply price (Z) of the corresponding output and the sum (D1) which the entrepreneurs can expect to get back out of the expenditure of consumers. Hence, if there is no change in the propensity to consume, employment cannot increase, unless at the same time D2 is increasing so as to fill the increasing gap between Z and D1. Thus— except on the special assumptions of the classical theory according to which there is some force in operation which, when employment increases, always causes D2 to increase sufficiently to fill the widening gap between Z and D1—the economic system may find itself in stable equilibrium with N at a level below full employment, namely at the level given by the intersection of the aggregate demand function with the aggregate supply function.\n",
    "Thus the volume of employment is not determined by the marginal disutility of labour measured in terms of real wages, except in so far as the supply of labour available at a given real wage sets a maximum level to employment. The propensity to consume and the rate of new investment determine between them the volume of employment, and the volume of employment is uniquely related to a given level of real wages—not the other way round. If the propensity to consume and the rate of new investment result in a deficient effective demand, the actual level of employment will fall short of the supply of labour potentially available at the existing real wage, and the equilibrium real wage will be greater than the marginal disutility of the equilibrium level of employment.\n",
    "This analysis supplies us with an explanation of the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty. For the mere existence of an insufficiency of effective demand may, and often will, bring the increase of employment to a standstill before a level of full employment has been reached. The insufficiency of\n",
    "23\n",
    "\n",
    "effective demand will inhibit the process of production in spite of the fact that the marginal product of labour still exceeds in value the marginal disutility of employment.\n",
    "Moreover the richer the community, the wider will tend to be the gap between its actual and its potential production; and therefore the more obvious and outrageous the defects of the economic system. For a poor community will be prone to consume by far the greater part of its output, so that a very modest measure of investment will be sufficient to provide full employment; whereas a wealthy community will have to discover much ampler opportunities for investment if the saving propensities of its wealthier members are to be compatible with the employment of its poorer members. If in a potentially wealthy community the inducement to invest is weak, then, in spite of its potential wealth, the working of the principle of effective demand will compel it to reduce its actual output, until, in spite of its potential wealth, it has become so poor that its surplus over its consumption is sufficiently diminished to correspond to the weakness of the inducement to invest.\n",
    "But worse still. Not only is the marginal propensity to consume weaker in a wealthy community, but, owing to its accumulation of capital being already larger, the opportunities for further investment are less attractive unless the rate of interest falls at a sufficiently rapid rate; which 'brings us to the theory of the rate of interest and to the reasons why it does not automatically fall to the appropriate level, which will occupy Book IV.\n",
    "Thus the analysis of the propensity to consume, the definition of the marginal efficiency of capital and the theory of the rate of interest are the three main gaps in our existing knowledge which it will be necessary to fill. When this has been accomplished, we shall find that the theory of prices falls into its proper place as a matter which is subsidiary to our general theory. We shall discover, however, that money plays an essential part in our theory of the rate of interest; and we shall attempt to disentangle the peculiar characteristics of money which distinguish it from other things.\n",
    "III\n",
    "The idea that we can safely neglect the aggregate demand function is fundamental to the Ricardian economics, which underlie what we have been taught for more than a century. Malthus, indeed, had vehemently opposed Ricardo's doctrine that it was impossible for effective demand to be deficient; but vainly. For, since Malthus was unable to explain clearly (apart from an appeal to the facts of common observation) how and why effective demand could be deficient or excessive, he failed to furnish an alternative construction; and Ricardo conquered England as completely as the Holy Inquisition conquered Spain. Not only was his theory accepted by the city, by statesmen and by the academic world. But controversy ceased; the other point of view completely disappeared; it ceased to be discussed. The great puzzle of effective demand with which Malthus had wrestled vanished from economic literature. You will not find it mentioned even once in the whole works of Marshall, Edgeworth and Professor Pigou, from whose hands the classical theory has received its most mature embodiment. It could only live on furtively, below the surface, in the underworlds of Karl Marx, Silvio Gesell or Major Douglas.\n",
    "The completeness of the Ricardian victory is something of a curiosity and a mystery. It must have been due to a complex of suitabilities in the doctrine to the environment into which it was projected. That it reached conclusions quite different from what the ordinary uninstructed person would expect, added, I suppose, to its intellectual prestige. That its teaching, translated into practice, was\n",
    "24\n",
    "\n",
    "austere and often unpalatable, lent it virtue. That it was adapted to carry a vast and consistent logical superstructure, gave it beauty. That it could explain much social injustice and apparent cruelty as an inevitable incident in the scheme of progress, and the attempt to change such things as likely on the whole to do more harm than good, commended it to authority. That it afforded a measure of justification to the free activities of the individual capitalist, attracted to it the support of the dominant social force behind authority.\n",
    "But although the doctrine itself has remained unquestioned by orthodox economists up to a late date, its signal failure for purposes of scientific prediction has greatly impaired, in the course of time, the prestige of its practitioners. For professional economists, after Malthus, were apparently unmoved by the lack of correspondence between the results of their theory and the facts of observation;—a discrepancy which the ordinary man has not failed to observe, with the result of his growing unwillingness to accord to economists that measure of respect which he gives to other groups of scientists whose theoretical results are confirmed by observation when they are applied to the facts.\n",
    "The celebrated optimism of traditional economic theory, which has led to economists being looked upon as Candides, who, having left this world for the cultivation of their gardens, teach that all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds provided we will let well alone, is also to be traced, I think, to their having neglected to take account of the drag on prosperity which can be exercised by an insufficiency of effective demand. For there would obviously be a natural tendency towards the optimum employment of resources in a society which was functioning after the manner of the classical postulates. It may well be that the classical theory represents the way in which we should like our economy to behave. But to assume that it actually does so is to assume our difficulties away.\n",

    "NOTES ON MERCANTILISM, THE USURY LAWS, STAMPED MONEY AND THEORIES OF UNDER-CONSUMPTION\n",
    "I\n",
    "For some two hundred years both economic theorists and practical men did not doubt that there is a peculiar advantage to a country in a favourable balance of trade, and grave danger in an unfavourable balance, particularly if it results in an effiux of the precious metals. But for the past one hundred years there has been a remarkable divergence of opinion. The majority of statesmen and practical men in most countries, and nearly half of them even in Great Britain, the home of the opposite view, have remained faithful to the ancient doctrine; whereas almost all economic theorists have held that anxiety concerning such matters is absolutely groundless except on a very short view, since the mechanism of foreign trade is self-adjusting and attempts to interfere with it are not only futile, but greatly impoverish those who practise them because they forfeit the advantages of the international division of labour. It will be convenient, in accordance with tradition, to designate the older opinion as mercantilism and the newer as free trade, though these terms, since each of them has both a broader and a narrower signification, must be interpreted with reference to the context.\n",
    "Generally speaking, modern economists have maintained not merely that there is, as a rule, a balance of gain from the international division of labour sufficient to outweigh such advantages as mercantilist practice can fairly claim, but that the mercantilist argument is based, from start to finish, on an intellectual confusion.\n",
    "Marshall,for example, although his references to mercantilism are not altogether unsympathetic, had no regard for their central theory as such and does not even mention those elements of truth in their contentions which I shall examine below. In the same way, the theoretical concessions which free- trade economists have been ready to make in contemporary controversies, relating, for example, to the encouragement of infant industries or to the improvement of the terms of trade, are not concerned with the real substance of the mercantilist case. During the fiscal controversy of the first quarter of the present century I do not remember that any concession was ever allowed by economists to the claim that protection might increase domestic employment. It will be fairest, perhaps, to quote, as an example, what I wrote myself. So lately as 1923, as a faithful pupil of the classical school who did not at that time doubt what he had been taught and entertained on this matter no reserves at all, I wrote: 'If there is one thing that Protection can not do, it is to cure Unemployment. . .There are some arguments for Protection, based upon its securing possible but improbable advantages, to which there is no simple answer. But the claim to cure Unemployment involves the Protectionist fallacy in its grossest and crudest form.' As for earlier mercantilist theory,\n",
    "165\n",
    "no intelligible account was available; and we were brought up to believe that it was little better than nonsense. So absolutely overwhelming and complete has been the domination of the classical school.\n",
    "II\n",
    "Let me first state in my own terms what now seems to me to be the element of scientific truth in mercantilist doctrine. We will then compare this with the actual arguments of the mercantilists. It should be understood that the advantages claimed are avowedly national advantages and are unlikely to benefit the world as a whole.\n",
    "When a country is growing in wealth somewhat rapidly, the further progress of this happy state of affairs is liable to be interrupted, in conditions of laissez-faire, by the insufficiency of the inducements to new investment. Given the social and political environment and the national characteristics which determine the propensity to consume, the well-being of a progressive state essentially depends, for the reasons we have already explained, on the sufficiency of such inducements. They may be found either in home investment or in foreign investment (including in the latter the accumulation of the precious metals), which, between them, make up aggregate investment. In conditions in which the quantity of aggregate investment is determined by the profit motive alone, the opportunities for home investment will be governed, in the long run, by the domestic rate of interest; whilst the volume of foreign investment is necessarily determined by the size of the favourable balance of trade. Thus, in a society where there is no question of direct investment under the aegis of public authority, the\n",
    "economic objects, with which it is reasonable for the government to be preoccupied, are the domestic rate of interest and the balance of foreign trade.\n",
    "Now, if the wage-unit is somewhat stable and not liable to spontaneous changes of significant magnitude (a condition which is almost always satisfied), if the state of liquidity-preference is somewhat stable, taken as an average of its short-period fluctuations, and if banking conventions are also stable, the rate of interest will tend to be governed by the quantity of the precious metals, measured in terms of the wage-unit, available to satisfy the community's desire for liquidity. At the same time, in an age in which substantial foreign loans and the outright ownership of wealth located abroad are scarcely practicable, increases and decreases in the quantity of the precious metals will largely depend on whether the balance of trade is favourable or unfavourable.\n",
    "Thus, as it happens, a preoccupation on the part of the authorities with a favourable balance of trade served both purposes; and was, furthermore, the only available means of promoting them. At a time when the authorities had no direct control over the domestic rate of interest or the other inducements to home investment, measures to increase the favourable balance of trade were the only direct means at their disposal for increasing foreign investment; and, at the same time, the effect of a favourable balance of trade on the influx of the precious metals was their only indirect means of reducing the domestic rate of interest and so increasing the inducement to home investment.\n",
    "There are, however, two limitations on the success of this policy which must not be overlooked. If the domestic rate of interest falls so low that the volume of investment is sufficiently stimulated to\n",
    "166\n",
    "\n",
    "raise employment to a level which breaks through some of the critical points at which the wage-unit rises, the increase in the domestic level of costs will begin to react unfavourably on the balance of foreign trade, so that the effort to increase the latter will have overreached and defeated itself. Again, if the domestic rate of interest falls so low relatively to rates of interest elsewhere as to stimulate a volume of foreign lending which is disproportionate to the favourable balance, there may ensue an effiux of the precious metals sufficient to reverse the advantages previously obtained. The risk of one or other of these limitations becoming operative is increased in the case of a country which is large and internationally important by the fact that, in conditions where the current output of the precious metals from the mines is on a relatively small scale, an influx of money into one country means an effiux from another; so that the adverse effects of rising costs and falling rates of interest at home may be accentuated (if the mercantilist policy is pushed too far) by falling costs and rising rates of interest abroad.\n",
    "The economic history of Spain in the latter part of the fifteenth and in the sixteenth centuries provides an example of a country whose foreign trade was destroyed by the effect on the wage-unit of an excessive abundance of the precious metals. Great Britain in the pre-war years of the twentieth century provides an example of a country in which the excessive facilities for foreign lending and the purchase of properties abroad frequently stood in the way of the decline in the domestic rate of interest which was required to ensure full employment at home. The history of India at all times has provided an example of a country impoverished by a preference for liquidity amounting to so strong a passion that even an enormous and chronic influx of the precious metals has been insufficient to bring down the rate of interest to a level which was compatible with the growth of real wealth.\n",
    "Nevertheless, if we contemplate a society with a somewhat stable wage-unit, with national characteristics which determine the propensity to consume and the preference for liquidity, and with a monetary system which rigidly links the quantity of money to the stock of the precious metals, it will be essential for the maintenance of prosperity that the authorities should pay close attention to the state of the balance of trade. For a favourable balance, provided it is not too large, will prove extremely stimulating; whilst an unfavourable balance may soon produce a state of persistent depression.\n",
    "It does not follow from this that the maximum degree of restriction of imports will promote the maximum favourable balance of trade. The earlier mercantilists laid great emphasis on this and were often to be found opposing trade restrictions because on a long view they were liable to operate adversely to a favourable balance. It is, indeed, arguable that in the special circumstances of mid-nineteenth-century Great Britain an almost complete freedom of trade was the policy most conducive to the development of a favourable balance. Contemporary experience of trade restrictions in post-war Europe offers manifold examples of ill-conceived impediments on freedom which, designed to improve the favourable balance, had in fact a contrary tendency.\n",
    "For this and other reasons the reader must not reach a premature conclusion as to the practical policy to which our argument leads up. There are strong presumptions of a general character against trade restrictions unless they can be justified on special grounds. The advantages of the international division of labour are real and substantial, even though the classical school greatly overstressed them. The fact that the advantage which our own country gains from a favourable balance is liable to involve an equal disadvantage to some other country (a point to which the mercantilists were\n",
    "167\n",
    "\n",
    "fully alive) means not only that great moderation is necessary, so that a country secures for itself no larger a share of the stock of the precious metals than is fair and reasonable, but also that an immoderate policy may lead to a senseless international competition for a favourable balance which injures all alike. And finally, a policy of trade restrictions is a treacherous instrument even for the attainment of its ostensible object, since private interest, administrative incompetence and the intrinsic difficulty of the task may divert it into producing results directly opposite to those intended.\n",
    "Thus, the weight of my criticism is directed against the inadequacy of the theoretical foundations of the laissez-faire doctrine upon which I was brought up and which for many years I taught;—against the notion that the rate of interest and the volume of investment are self-adjusting at the optimum level, so that preoccupation with the balance of trade is a waste of time. For we, the faculty of economists, prove to have been guilty of presumptuous error in treating as a puerile obsession what for centuries has been a prime object of practical statecraft.\n",
    "Under the influence of this faulty theory the City of London gradually devised the most dangerous technique for the maintenance of equilibrium which can possibly be imagined, namely, the technique of bank rate coupled with a rigid parity of the foreign exchanges. For this meant that the objective of maintaining a domestic rate of interest consistent with full employment was wholly ruled out. Since, in practice, it is impossible to neglect the balance of payments, a means of controlling it was evolved which, instead of protecting the domestic rate of interest, sacrificed it to the operation of blind forces. Recently, practical bankers in London have learnt much, and one can almost hope that in Great Britain the technique of bank rate will never be used again to protect the foreign balance in conditions in which it is likely to cause unemployment at home.\n",
    "Regarded as the theory of the individual firm and of the distribution of the product resulting from the employment of a given quantity of resources, the classical theory has made a contribution to economic thinking which cannot be impugned. It is impossible to think clearly on the subject without this theory as a part of one's apparatus of thought. I must not be supposed to question this in calling attention to their neglect of what was valuable in their predecessors. Nevertheless, as a contribution to statecraft, which is concerned with the economic system as a whole and with securing the optimum employment of the system's entire resources, the methods of the early pioneers of economic thinking in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may have attained to fragments of practical wisdom which the unrealistic abstractions of Ricardo first forgot and then obliterated. There was wisdom in their intense preoccupation with keeping down the rate of interest by means of usury laws (to which we will return later in this chapter), by maintaining the domestic stock of money and by discouraging rises in the wage-unit; and in their readiness in the last resort to restore the stock of money by devaluation, if it had become plainly deficient through an unavoidable foreign drain, a rise in the wage-unit,or any other cause.\n",
    "III\n",
    "The early pioneers of economic thinking may have hit upon their maxims of practical wisdom without having had much cognisance of the underlying theoretical grounds. Let us, therefore, examine briefly the reasons they gave as well as what they recommended. This is made easy by reference to Professor Heckscher's great work on Mercantilism, in which the essential\n",
    "168\n",
    "\n",
    "characteristics of economic thought over a period of two centuries are made available for the first time to the general economic reader. The quotations which follow are mainly taken from his pages.\n",
    "(1) Mercantilists' thought never supposed that there was a self-adjusting tendency by which the rate of interest would be established at the appropriate level. On the contrary they were emphatic that an unduly high rate of interest was the main obstacle to the growth of wealth; and they were even aware that the rate of interest depended on liquidity-preference and the quantity of money. They were concerned both with diminishing liquidity-preference and with increasing the quantity of money, and several of them made it clear that their preoccupation with increasing the quantity of money was due to their desire to diminish the rate of interest. Professor Heckscher sums up this aspect of their theory as follows:\n",
    "The position of the more perspicacious mercantilists was in this respect, as in many others, perfectly clear within certain limits. For them, money was—to use the terminology of to-day—a factor of production, on the same footing as land, sometimes regarded as 'artificial' wealth as distinct from the 'natural' wealth; interest on capital was the payment for the renting of money similar to rent for land. In so far as mercantilists sought to discover objective reasons for the height of the rate of interest—and they did so more and more during this period—they found such reasons in the total quantity of money. From the abundant material available, only the most typical examples will be selected, so as to demonstrate first and foremost how lasting this notion was, how deep-rooted and independent of practical considerations.\n",
    "Both of the protagonists in the struggle over monetary policy and the East India trade in the early 1620's in England were in entire agreement on this point. Gerard Malynes stated, giving detailed reason for his assertion, that 'Plenty of money decreaseth usury in price or rate' (Lex Mercatoria and Maintenance of Free Trade, 1622). His truculent and rather unscrupulous adversary, Edward Misselden, replied that 'The remedy for Usury may be plenty of money' (Free Trade or the Meanes to make Trade Florish, same year). Of the leading writers of half a century later, Child, the omnipotent leader of the East India Company and its most skilful advocate, discussed (1668) the question of how far the legal maximum rate of interest, which he emphatically demanded, would result in drawing 'the money' of the Dutch away from England. He found a remedy for this dreaded disadvantage in the easier transference of bills of debt, if these were used as currency, for this, he said, 'will certainly supply the defect of at least one-half of all the ready money we have in use in the nation'. Petty, the other writer, who was entirely unaffected by the clash of interests, was in agreement with the rest when he explained the 'natural' fall in the rate of interest from 10 per cent to 6 per cent by the increase in the amount of money (Political Arithmetick, 1676), and advised lending at interest as an appropriate remedy for a country with too much 'Coin' (Quantulumcunque concerning Money, 1682).\n",
    "This reasoning, naturally enough, was by no means confined to England. Several years later (1701 and 1706), for example, French merchants and statesmen complained of the prevailing scarcity of coin (disette des espèces) as the cause of the high interest rates, and they were anxious to lower the rate of usury by increasing the circulation of money.\n",
    "The great Locke was, perhaps, the first to express in abstract terms the relationship between the rate of interest and the quantity of money in his controversy with Petty. He was opposing Petty's proposal of a maximum rate of interest on the ground that it was as impracticable as to fix a\n",
    "169\n",
    "\n",
    "maximum rent for land, since 'the natural Value of Money, as it is apt to yield such an yearly Income by Interest, depends on the whole quantity of the then passing Money of the Kingdom, in proportion to the whole Trade of the Kingdom (i.e. the general Vent of all the commodities)'. Locke explains that money has two values: (i) its value in use which is given by the rate of interest and in this it has the Nature of Land, the Income of one being called Rent, of the other, Use', and (2) its value in exchange 'and in this it has the Nature of a Commodity', its value in exchange 'depending only on the Plenty or Scarcity of Money in proportion to the Plenty or Scarcity of those things and not on what Interest shall be'. Thus Locke was the parent of twin quantity theories. In the first place he held that the rate of interest depended on the proportion of the quantity of money (allowing for the velocity of circulation) to the total value of trade. In the second place he held that the value of money in exchange depended on the proportion of the quantity of money to the total volume of goods in the market. But—standing with one foot in the mercantilist world and with one foot in the classical world—he was confused concerning the relation between these two proportions, and he overlooked altogether the possibility of fluctuations in liquidity-preference. He was, however, eager to explain that a reduction in the rate of interest has no direct effect on the price-level and affects prices 'only as the Change of Interest in Trade conduces to the bringing in or carrying out Money or Commodity, and so in time varying their Proportion here in England from what it was before', i.e. if the reduction in the rate of interest leads to the export of cash or an increase in output. But he never, I think, proceeds to a genuine synthesis.\n",
    "How easily the mercantilist mind distinguished between the rate of interest and the marginal efficiency of capital is illustrated by a passage (printed in 1621) which Locke quotes from A Letter to a friend concerning Usury: 'High Interest decays Trade. The advantage from Interest is greater than the Profit from Trade, which makes the rich Merchants give over, and put out their Stock to Interest, and the lesser Merchants Break.' Fortrey (England's Interest and Improvement, 1663) affords another example of the stress laid on a low rate of interest as a means of increasing wealth.\n",
    "The mercantilists did not overlook the point that, if an excessive liquidity-preference were to withdraw the influx of precious metals into hoards, the advantage to the rate of interest would be lost. In some cases (e.g. Mun) the object of enhancing the power of the State led them, nevertheless, to advocate the accumulation of state treasure. But others frankly opposed this policy:\n",
    "Schrötter, for instance, employed the usual mercantilist arguments in drawing a lurid picture of how the circulation in the country would be robbed of all its money through a greatly increasing state treasury. . .he, too, drew a perfectly logical parallel between the accumulation of treasure by the monasteries and the export surplus of precious metals, which, to him, was indeed the worst possible thing which he could think of. Davenant explained the extreme poverty of many Eastern nations— who were believed to have more gold and silver than any other countries in the world—by the fact that treasure 'is suffered to stagnate in the Princes' Coffers'. . .If hoarding by the state was considered, at best, a doubtful boon, and often a great danger, it goes without saying that private hoarding was to be shunned like the pest. It was one of the tendencies against which innumerable mercantilist writers thundered, and I do not think it would be possible to find a single dissentient voice.\n",
    "(2) The mercantilists were aware of the fallacy of cheapness and the danger that excessive competition may turn the terms of trade against a country. Thus Malynes wrote in his Lex Mercatoria (1622): 'Strive not to undersell others to the hurt of the Commonwealth, under colour to\n",
    "170\n",
    "\n",
    "increase trade: for trade doth not increase when commodities are good cheap, because the cheapness proceedeth of the small request and scarcity of money, which maketh things cheap: so that the contrary augmenteth trade when there is plenty of money, and commodities become dearer being in request'. Professor Heckscher sums up as follows this strand in mercantilist thought:\n",
    "In the course of a century and a half this standpoint was formulated again and again in this way, that a country with relatively less money than other countries must 'sell cheap and buy dear'. . .\n",
    "Even in the original edition of the Discourse of the Common Weal, that is in the middle of the 16th century, this attitude was already manifested. Hales said, in fact, 'And yet if strangers should be content to take but our wares for theirs, what should let them to advance the price of other things (meaning: among others, such as we buy from them), though ours were good cheap unto them? And then shall we be still losers, and they at the winning hand with us, while they sell dear and yet buy ours good cheap, and consequently enrich themselves and impoverish us. Yet had I rather advance our wares in price, as they advance theirs, as we now do; though some be losers thereby, and yet not so many as should be the other way.' On this point he had the unqualified approval of his editor several decades later (1581). In the 17th century, this attitude recurred again without any fundamental change in significance. Thus, Malynes believed this unfortunate position to be the result of what he dreaded above all things, i.e. a foreign under-valuation of the English exchange. . .The same conception then recurred continually. In his Verbum Sapienti (written 1665, published 1691), Petty believed that the violent efforts to increase the quantity of money could only cease 'when we have certainly more money than any of our Neighbour States (though never so little), both in Arithmetical and Geometrical proportion'. During the period between the writing and the publication of this work, Coke declared, 'If our Treasure were more than our Neighbouring Nations, I did not care whether we had one fifth part of the Treasure we now have' (1675).\n",
    "(3) The mercantilists were the originals of 'the fear of goods' and the scarcity of money as causes of unemployment which the classicals were to denounce two centuries later as an absurdity:\n",
    "One of the earliest instances of the application of the unemployment argument as a reason for the prohibition of imports is to be found in Florence in the year 1426. . . .The English legislation on the matter goes back to at least 1455. . . .An almost contemporary French decree of 1466, forming the basis of the silk industry of Lyons, later to become so famous, was less interesting in so far as it was not actually directed against foreign goods. But it, too, mentioned the possibility of giving work to tens of thousands of unemployed men and women. It is seen how very much this argument was in the air at the time. . .\n",
    "The first great discussion of this matter, as of nearly all social and economic problems, occurred in England in the middle of the i6th century or rather earlier, during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI. In this connection we cannot but mention a series of writings, written apparently at the latest in the 1530's, two of which at any rate are believed to have been by Clement Armstrong. . .He formulates it, for example, in the following terms: 'By reason of great abundance of strange merchandises and wares brought yearly into England hath not only caused scarcity of money, but hath destroyed all handicrafts, whereby great number of common people should have works to get money to pay for their meat and drink, which of very necessity must live idly and beg and steal'.\n",
    "171\n",
    "\n",
    "The best instance to my knowledge of a typically mercantilist discussion of a state of affairs of this kind is the debates in the English House of Commons concerning the scarcity of money, which occurred in 1621, when a serious depression had set in, particularly in the cloth export. The conditions 'vere described very clearly by one of the most influential members of parliament, Sir Edwin Sandys. He stated that the farmer and the artificer had to suffer almost everywhere, that looms were standing idle for want of money in the country, and that peasants were forced to repudiate their contracts, 'not (thanks be to God) for want of fruits of the earth, but for want of money'. The situation led to detailed enquiries into where the money could have got to, the want of which was felt so bitterly. Numerous attacks were directed against all persons who were supposed to have contributed either to an export (export surplus) of precious metals, or to their disappearance on account of corresponding activities within the country.\n",
    "Mercantilists were conscious that their policy, as Professor Heckscher puts it, 'killed two birds with one stone'. 'On the one hand the country was rid of an unwelcome surplus of goods, which was believed to result in unemployment, while on the other the total stock of money in the country was increased', with the resulting advantages of a fall in the rate of interest.\n",
    "It is impossible to study the notions to which the mercantilists were led by their actual experiences, without perceiving that there has been a cbronic tendency throughout human history for the propensity to save to be stronger than the inducement to invest. The weakness of the inducement to invest has been at all times the key to the economic problem. To-day the explanation of the weakness of this inducement may chiefly lie in the extent of existing accumulations; whereas, formerly, risks and hazards of all kinds may have played a larger part. But the result is the same. The desire of, the individual to augment his personal wealth by abstaining from consumption has usually been stronger than the inducement to the entrepreneur to augment the national wealth by employing labour on the construction of durable assets.\n",
    "(4) The mercantilists were under no illusions as to the nationalistic character of their policies and their tendency to promote war. It was national advantage and relative strength at which they were admittedly aiming.\n",
    "We may criticise them for the apparent indifference with which they accepted this inevitable consequence of an international monetary system. But intellectually their realism is much preferable to the confused thinking of contemporary advocates of an international fixed gold standard and laissez-faire in international lending, who believe that it is precisely these policies which will best promote peace.\n",
    "For in an economy subject to money contracts and customs more or less fixed over an appreciable period of time, where the quantity of the domestic circulation and the domestic rate of interest are primarily determined by the balance of payments, as they were in Great Britain before the war, there is no orthodox means open to the authorities for countering unemployment at home except by struggling for an export surplus and an import of the monetary metal at the expense of their neighbours. Never in history was there a method devised ofsuch efficacy for setting each country's advantage at variance with its neighbours' as the international gold (or, formerly, silver) standard. For it made domestic prosperity directly dependent on a competitive pursuit of markets and a competitive appetite for the precious metals. When by happy accident the new supplies of gold and silver were comparatively abundant, the struggle might be somewhat abated. But with the growth of\n",
    "172\n",
    "\n",
    "wealth and the diminishing marginal propensity to consume, it has tended to become increasingly internecine. The part played by orthodox economists, whose common sense has been insufficient to check their faulty logic, has been disastrous to the latest act. For when in their blind struggle for an escape, some countries have thrown off the obligations which had previously rendered impossible an autonomous rate of interest, these economists have taught that a restoration of the former shackles is a necessary first step to a general recovery.\n",
    "In truth the opposite holds good. It is the policy of an autonomous rate of interest, unimpeded by international preoccupations, and of a national investment programme directed to an optimum level of domestic employment which is twice blessed in the sense that it helps ourselves and our neighbours at the same time. And it is the simultaneous pursuit of these policies by all countries together which is capable of restoring economic health and strength internationally, whether we measure it by the level of domestic employment or by the volume of international trade.\n",
    "IV\n",
    "The mercantilists perceived the existence of the problem without being able to push their analysis to the point of solving it. But the classical school ignored the problem, as a consequence of introducing into their premisses conditions which involved its non-existence; with the result of creating a cleavage between the conclusions of economic theory and those of common sense. The extraordinary achievement of the classical theory was to overcome the beliefs of the 'natural man' and, at the same time, to be wrong. As Professor Heckscher expresses it:\n",
    "If, then, the underlying attitude towards money and the material from which money was created did not alter in the period between the Crusades and the 18th century, it follows that we are dealing with deep-rooted notions. Perhaps the same notions have persisted even beyond the 500 years included in that period, even though not nearly to the same degree as the 'fear of goods'. With the exception of the period of laissez-faire, no age has been free from these ideas. It was only the unique intellectual tenacity of laissez-faire that for a time overcame the beliefs of the 'natural man' on this point.\n",
    "It required the unqualified faith of doctrinaire laissez-faire to wipe out the 'fear of goods'. . .[which] is the most natural attitude of the 'natural man' in a money economy. Free Trade denied the existence of factors which appeared to be obvious, and was doomed to be discredited in the eyes of the man in the street as soon as laissez-faire could no longer hold the minds of men enchained in its ideology.\n",
    "I remember Bonar Law's mingled rage and perplexity in face of the economists, because they were denying what was obvious. He was deeply troubled for an explanation. One recurs to the analogy between the sway of the classical school of economic theory and that of certain religions. For it is a far greater exercise of the potency of an idea to exorcise the obvious than to introduce into men's common notions the recondite and the remote.\n",
    "V\n",
    "There remains an allied, but distinct, matter where for centuries, indeed for several millenniums, enlightened opinion held for certain and obvious a doctrine which the classical school has\n",
    "173\n",
    "\n",
    "repudiated as childish, but which deserves rehabilitation and honour. I mean the doctrine that the rate of interest is not self-adjusting at a level best suited to the social advantage but constantly tends to rise too high, so that a wise government is concerned to curb it by statute and custom and even by invoking the sanctions of the moral law.\n",
    "Provisions against usury are amongst the most ancient economic practices of which we have record. The destruction of the inducement to invest by an excessive liquidity-preference was the outstanding evil, the prime impediment to the growth of wealth, in the ancient and medieval worlds. And naturally so, since certain of the risks and hazards of economic life diminish the marginal efficiency of capital whilst others serve to increase the preference for liquidity. In a world, therefore, which no one reckoned to be safe, it was almost inevitable that the rate of interest, unless it was curbed by every instrument at the disposal of society, would rise too high to permit of an adequate inducement to invest.\n",
    "I was brought up to believe that the attitude of the Medieval Church to the rate of interest was inherently absurd, and that the subtle discussions aimed at distinguishing the return on money-loans from the return to active investment were merely jesuitical attempts to find a practical escape from a foolish theory. But I now read these discussions as an honest intellectual effort to keep separate what the classical theory has inextricably confused together, namely, the rate of interest and the marginal efficiency of capital. For it now seems clear that the disquisitions of the schoolmen were directed towards the elucidation of a formula which should allow the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital to be high, whilst using rule and custom and the moral law to keep down the rate of interest.\n",
    "Even Adam Smith was extremely moderate in his attitude to the usury laws. For lie was well aware that individual savings may be absorbed either by investment or by debts, and that there is no security that they will find an outlet in the former. Furthermore, he favoured a low rate of interest as increasing the chance of savings finding their outlet in new investment rather than in debts; and for this reason, in a passage for which he was severely taken to task by Bentham, he defended a moderate application of the usury laws. Moreover, Bentham's criticisms were mainly on the ground that Adam Smith's Scotch caution was too severe on 'projectors' and that a maximum rate of interest would leave too little margin for the reward of legitimate and socially advisable risks. For Bentham understood by projectors 'all such persons, as, in the pursuit of wealth, or even of any other object, endeavour, by the assistance of wealth, to strike into any channel of invention. . .upon all such persons as, in the line of any of their pursuits, aim at anything that can be called improvement. . .It falls, in short, upon every application of the human powers, in which ingenuity stands in need of wealth for its assistance.' Of course Bentham is right in protesting against laws which stand in the way of taking legitimate risks. 'A prudent man', Bentham continues, 'will not, in these circumstances, pick out the good projects\n",
    "from the bad, for he will not meddle with projects at all.'\n",
    "It may be doubted, perhaps, whether the above is just what Adam Smith intended by his term. Or is it that we are hearing in Bentham (though writing in March 1787 from 'Crichoff in White Russia') the voice of nineteenth-century England speaking to the eighteenth? For nothing short of the exuberance of the greatest age of the inducement to investment could have made it possible to lose sight of the theoretical possibility of its insufficiency.\n",

    "It is convenient to mention at this point the strange, unduly neglected prophet Silvio Gesell (1862−1930), whose work contains flashes of deep insight and who only just failed to reach down to the essence of the matter. In the post-war years his devotees bombarded me with copies of his works; yet, owing to certain palpable defects in the argument, I entirely failed to discover their merit. As is often the case with imperfectly analysed intuitions, their significance only became apparent after I had reached my own conclusions in my own way. Meanwhile, like other academic economists, I treated his profoundly original strivings as being no better than those of a crank. Since few of the readers of this book are likely to be well acquainted with the significance of Gesell, I will give to him what would be otherwise a disproportionate space.\n",
    "Gesell was a successful German merchant in Buenos Aires who was led to the study of monetary problems by the crisis of the late 'eighties, which was especially violent in the Argentine, his first work, Die Reformation im Münzwesen als Brücke zum socialen Staat, being published in Buenos Aires in 1891. His fundamental ideas on money were published in Buenos Aires in the same year under the title Nervus rerum, and many books and pamphlets followed until he retired to Switzerland in 1906 as a man of some means, able to devote the last decades of his life to the two most delightful occupations open to those who do not have to earn their living, authorship and experimental farming.\n",
    "The first section of his standard work was published in 1906 at Les Hauts Geneveys, Switzerland, under the title Die Verwirklichung des Rechtes auf dem vollen\n",
    "Arbeitsertrag, and the second section in 1911 at Berlin under the title Die neue Lehre vom Zins. The two together were published in Berlin and in Switzerland during the war (1916) and reached a sixth edition during his lifetime under the title Die natürliche Wirtschaftsordnung durch Freiland und Freigeld, the English version (translated by Mr Philip Pye) being called The Natural Economic Order. In April 1919 Gesell joined the short-lived Soviet cabinet of Bavaria as their Minister of Finance, being subsequently tried by court-martial. The last decade of his life was spent in Berlin and Switzerland and devoted to propaganda. Gesell, drawing to himself the semi-religious fervour which had formerly centred round Henry George, became the revered prophet of a cult with many thousand disciples throughout the world. The first international convention of the Swiss and German Freiland−Freigeld Bund and similar organisations from many countries was held in Basle in 1923. Since his death in 1930 much of the peculiar type of fervour which doctrines such as his are capable of exciting has been diverted to other (in my opinion less eminent) prophets. Dr Buchi is the leader of the movement in England, but its literature seems to be distributed from San Antonio, Texas, its main strength lying to-day in the United States, where Professor Irving Fisher, alone amongst academic economists, has recognised its significance.\n",
    "In spite of the prophetic trappings with which his devotees have decorated him, Gesell's main book is written in cool, scientific language; though it is suffused throughout by a more passionate, a more emotional devotion to social justice than some think decent in a scientist. The part which derives from Henry George,though doubtless an important source of the movement's strength, is of altogether secondary interest. The purpose of the book as a whole may be described as the establishment of an anti-Marxian socialism, a reaction against laissez-faire built on theoretical foundations totally unlike those of Marx in being based on a repudiation instead of on an acceptance\n",
    "175\n",
    "\n",
    "of the classical hypotheses, and on an unfettering of competition instead of its abolition. I believe that the future will learn more from the spirit of Gesell than from that of Marx. The preface to The Natural Economic Order will indicate to the reader, if he will refer to it, the moral quality of Gesell. The answer to Marxism is, I think, to be found along the lines of this preface.\n",
    "Gesell's specific contribution to the theory of money and interest is as follows. In the first place, he distinguishes clearly between the rate of interest and the marginal efficiency of capital, and he argues that it is the rate of interest which sets a limit to the rate of growth of real capital. Next, he points out that the rate of interest is a purely monetary phenomenon and that the peculiarity of money, from which flows the significance of the money rate of interest, lies in the fact that its ownership as a means of storing wealth involves the holder in negligible carrying charges, and that forms of wealth, such as stocks of commodities which do involve carrying charges, in fact yield a return because of the standard set by money. He cites the comparative stability of the rate of interest throughout the ages as evidence that it cannot depend on purely physical characters, inasmuch as the variation of the latter from one epoch to another must have been incalculably greater than the observed changes in the rate of interest; i.e. (in my terminology) the rate of interest, which depends on constant psychological characters, has remained stable, whilst the widely fluctuating characters, which primarily determine the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, have determined not the rate of interest but the rate at which the (more or less) given rate of interest allows the stock of real capital to grow.\n",
    "But there is a great defect in Gesell's theory. He shows how it is only the existence of a rate of money interest which allows a yield to be obtained from lending out stocks of commodities. His dialogue between Robinson Crusoe and a stranger is a most excellent economic parable—as good as anything of the kind that has been written—to demonstrate this point. But, having given the reason why the money-rate of interest unlike most commodity rates of interest cannot be negative, he altogether overlooks the need of an explanation why the money-rate of interest is positive, and he fails to explain why the money-rate of interest is not governed (as the classical school maintains) by the standard set by the yield on productive capital. This is because the notion of liquidity- preference had escaped him. He has constructed only half a theory of the rate of interest.\n",
    "The incompleteness of his theory is doubtless the explanation of his work having suffered neglect at the hands of the academic world. Nevertheless he had carried his theory far enough to lead him to a practical recommendation, which may carry with it the essence of what is needed, though it is not feasible in the form in which he proposed it. He argues that the growth of real capital is held back by the money-rate of interest, and that if this brake were removed the growth of real capital would be, in the modern world, so rapid that a zero money-rate of interest would probably be justified, not indeed forthwith, but within a comparatively short period of time. Thus the prime necessity is to reduce the money-rate of interest, and this, he pointed out, can be effected by causing money to incur carrying-costs just like other stocks of barren goods. This led him to the famous prescription of 'stamped' money, with which his name is chiefly associated and which has received the blessing of Professor Irving Fisher. According to this proposal currency notes (though it would clearly need to apply as well to some forms at least of bank-money) would only retain their value by being stamped each month, like an insurance card, with stamps purchased at a post office. The cost of the stamps could, of course, be fixed at any appropriate figure. According to my theory it should be roughly equal to the excess of the money-rate of interest (apart from the stamps) over the marginal efficiency of capital corresponding to a rate of new investment compatible with full employment.\n",

    "The actual charge suggested by Gesell was 1 per mil. per week, equivalent to 5.2 per cent per annum. This would be too high in existing conditions, but the correct figure, which would have to be changed from time to time, could only be reached by trial and error.\n",
    "The idea behind stamped money is sound. It is, indeed, possible that means might be found to apply it in practice on a modest scale. But there are many difficulties which Gesell did not face. In particular, he was unaware that money was not unique in having a liquidity-premium attached to it, but differed only in degree from many other articles, deriving its importance from having a greater liquidity-premium than any other article. Thus if currency notes were to be deprived of their liquidity-premium by the stamping system, a long series of substitutes would step into their shoes— bank-money, debts at call, foreign money, jewellery and the precious metals generally, and so forth. As I have mentioned above, there have been times when it was probably the craving for the ownership of land, independently of its yield, which served to keep up the rate of interest;—though under Gesell's system this possibility would have been eliminated by land nationalisation.\n",

    "The theories which we have examined above are directed, in substance, to the constituent of effective demand which depends on the sufficiency of the inducement to invest. It is no new thing, however, to ascribe the evils of unemployment to the insufficiency of the other constituent, namely, the insufficiency of the propensity to consume. But this alternative explanation of the economic evils of the day—equally unpopular with the classical economists—played a much smaller part in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century thinking and has only gathered force in comparatively recent times.\n",
    "Though complaints of under-consumption were a very subsidiary aspect of mercantilist thought, Professor Heckscher quotes a number of examples of what he calls 'the deep-rooted belief in the utility of luxury and the evil of thrift. Thrift, in fact, was regarded as the cause of unemployment, and for two reasons: in the first place, because real income was believed to diminish by the amount of money which did not enter into exchange, and secondly, because saving was believed to withdraw money from circulation.' In 1598 Laffemas (Les Trésors et richesses pour mettre l'Estat en Splendeur) denounced the objectors to the use of French silks on the ground that all purchasers of French luxury goods created a livelihood for the poor, whereas the miser caused them to die in distress'. In 1662 Petty justified 'entertainments, magnificent shews, triumphal arches, etc.', on the ground that their costs flowed back into the pockets of brewers, bakers, tailors, shoemakers and so forth. Fortrey justified 'excess of apparel'. Von Schrötter (i686) deprecated sumptuary regulations and declared that he would wish that display in clothing and the like were even greater. Barbon (1690) wrote that 'Prodigality is a vice that is prejudicial to the Man, but not to trade. . .Covetousness is a Vice, prejudicial both to Man and Trade.' In 1695 Cary argued that if everybody spent more, all would obtain larger incomes 'and might then live more plentifully'.\n",
    "But it was by Bernard Mandeville's Fable of the Bees that Barbon's opinion was mainly popularised, a book convicted as a nuisance by the grand jury of Middlesex in 1723, which stands out in the history of the moral sciences for its scandalous reputation. Only one man is recorded as having spoken a good word for it, namely Dr Johnson, who declared that it did not puzzle him, but 'opened his eyes into real life very much'. The nature of the book's wickedness can be best conveyed by Leslie Stephen's summary in the Dictionary of National Biography:\n",

    "Mandeville gave great offence by this book, in which a cynical system of morality was made attractive by ingenious paradoxes. . .His doctrine that prosperity was increased by expenditure rather than by saving fell in with many current economic fallacies not yet extinct. Assuming with the ascetics that human desires were essentially evil and therefore produced 'private vices' and assuming with the common view that wealth was a 'public benefit', he easily showed that all civilisation implied the development of vicious propensities. . .\n",
    "The text of the Fable of the Bees is an allegorical poem—'The Grumbling Hive, or Knaves turned honest', in which is set forth the appalling plight of a prosperous community in which all the citizens suddenly take it into their heads to abandon luxurious living, and the State to cut down armaments, in the interests of Saving:\n",

    "Two extracts from the commentary which follows the allegory will show that the above was not without a theoretical basis:\n",
    "As this prudent economy, which some people call Saving, is in private families the most certain method to increase an estate, so some imagine that, whether a country be barren or fruitful, the same method if generally pursued (which they think practicable) will have the same effect upon a whole nation, and that, for example, the English might be much richer than they are, if they would be as frugal as some of their neighbours. This, I think, is an error.\n",
    "On the contrary, Mandeville concludes:\n",
    "The great art to make a nation happy, and what we call flourishing, consists in giving everybody an opportunity of being employed; which to compass, let a Government's first care be to promote as great a variety of Manufacures, Arts and Handicrafts as human wit can invent; and the second to encourage Agriculture and Fishery in all their branches, that the whole Earth may be forccd to exert itself as well as Man. It is from this Policy and not from the trifling regulations of Lavishness and Frugality that the greatness and felicity of Nations must be expected; for let the value of Gold and Silver rise or fall, the enjoyment of all Societies will ever depend upon the Fruits of the Earth and the Labour of the People; both which joined together are a more certain, a more inexhaustible and a more real Treasure than the Gold of Brazil or the Silver of Potosi.\n",
    "No wonder that such wicked sentiments called down the opprobrium of two centuries of moralists and economists who felt much more virtuous in possession of their austere doctrine that no sound remedy was discoverable except in the utmost of thrift and economy both by the individual and by the state. Petty's 'entertainments, magnificent shews, triumphal arches, etc.' gave place to the penny- wisdom of Gladstonian finance and to a state system which 'could not afford' hospitals, open spaces, noble buildings, even the preservation of its ancient monuments, far less the splendours of music and the drama, all of which were consigned to the private charity or magnanimity of improvident individuals.\n",
    "The doctrine did not reappear in respectable circles for another century, until in the later phase of Malthus the notion of the insufficiency of effective demand takes a definite place as a scientific explanation of unemployment. Since I have already dealt with this somewhat fully in my essay on Malthus, it will be sufficient if I repeat here one or two characteristic passages which I have already quoted in my essay:\n",
    "179\n",
    "\n",
    "We see in almost every part of the world vast powers of production which are not put into action, and I explain this phenomenon by saying that from the want of a proper distribution of the actual produce adequate motives are not furnished to continued production. . .I distinctly maintain that an attempt to accumulate very rapidly, which necessarily implies a considerable diminution of unproductive consumption, by greatly impairing the usual motives to production must prematurely check the progress of wealth. . . But if it be true that an attempt to accumulate very rapidly will occasion such a division between labour and profits as almost to destroy both the motive and the power of future accumulation and consequently the power of maintaining and employing an increasing population, must it not be acknowledged that such an attempt to accumulate, or that saving too much, may be really prejudicial to a country?\n",
    "The question is whether this stagnation of capital, and subsequent stagnation in the densand for labour arising from increased production without an adequate proportion of unproductive consumption on the part of the landlords and capitalists, could take place without prejudice to the country, without occasioning a less degree both of happiness and wealth than would have occurred if the unproductive consumption of the landlords and capitalists had been so proportioned to the natural surplus of the society as to have continued uninterrupted the motives to production, and prevented first an unnatural demand for labour and then a necessary and sudden diminution of such demand. But if this be so, how can it be said with truth that parsimony, though it may be prejudicial to the producers, cannot be prejudicial to the state; or that an increase of unproductive consumption among landlords and capitalists may not sometimes be the proper remedy for a state of things in which the motives to production fail?\n",
    "Adam Smith has stated that capitals are increased by parsimony, that every frugal man is a public benefactor, and that the increase of wealth depends upon the balance of produce above consumption. That these propositions are true to a great extent is perfectly unquestionable. . .But it is quite obvious that they are not true to an indefinite extent, and that the principles of saving, pushed to excess, would destroy the motive to production. If every person were satisfied with the simplest food, the poorest clothing, and the meanest houses, it is certain that no other sort of food, clothing, and lodging would be in existence. . .The two extremes are obvious; and it follows that there must be some intermediate point, though the resources of political economy may not be able to ascertain it, where, taking into consideration both the power to produce and the will to consume, the encouragement to the increase of wealth is the greatest.\n",
    "Of all the opinions advanced by able and ingenious men, which I have ever met with, the opinion of M. Say, which states that, Un produit consommé ou detruit est un débouché fermé (I. i. ch. 15), appears to me to be the most directly opposed to just theory, and the most uniformly contradicted by experience. Yet it directly follows from the new doctrine, that commodities are to be considered only in their relation to each other,—not to the consumers. What, I would ask, would become of the demand for commodities, if all consumption except bread and water were suspended for the next half-year? What an accumulation of commodities! Quels debouchés! What a prodigious market would this event occasion!\n",
    "Ricardo, however, was stone-deaf to what Malthus was saying. The last echo of the controversy is to be found in John Stuart Mill's discussion of his wages-fund theory, which in his own mind played a vital part in his rejection of the later phase of Malthus, amidst the discussions of which he had, of course, been brought up. Mill's successors rejected his wages-fund theory but overlooked the fact\n",
    "180\n",
    "\n",
    "that Mill's refutation of Malthus depended on it. Their method was to dismiss the problem from the corpus of economics not by solving it but by not mentioning it. It altogether disappeared from controversy. Mr Cairncross, searching recently for traces of it amongst the minor Victorians, has found even less, perhaps, than might have been expected. Theories of under-consumption hibernated until the appearance in 1889 of The Physiology of Industry, by J. A. Hobson and A. F. Mummery, the first and most significant of many volumes in which for nearly fifty years Mr Hobson has flung himself with unflagging, but almost unavailing, ardour and courage\n",
    "against the ranks of orthodoxy. Though it is so completely forgotten to-day, the publication of this book marks, in a sense, an epoch in economic thought.\n",
    "The Physiology of Industry was written in collaboration with A. F. Mummery. Mr Hobson has told how the book came to be written as follows:\n",
    "It was not until the middle 'eighties that my economic heterodoxy began to take shape. Though the Henry George campaign against land values and the early agitation of various socialist groups against the visible oppression of the working classes, coupled with the revelations of the two Booths regarding the poverty of London, made a deep impression on my feelings, they did not destroy my faith in Political Economy. That came from what may be called an accidental contact. While teaching at a school in Exeter I came into personal relations with a business man named Mummery, known then and afterwards as a great mountaineer who had discovered another way up the Matterhorn and who, in 1895, was killed in an attempt to climb the famous Himalayan mountain Nanga Parbat. My intercourse with him, I need hardly say, did not lie on this physical plane. But he was a mental climber as well, with a natural eye for a path of his own finding and a sublime disregard of intellectual authority. This man entangled me in a controversy about excessive saving, which he regarded as responsible for the under-employment of capital and labour in periods of bad trade. For a long time I sought to counter his arguments by the use of the orthodox economic weapons. But at length he convinced me and I went in with him to elaborate the over-saving argument in a book entitled The Physiology of Industry, which was published in 1889. This was the first open step in my heretical career, and I did not in the least realise its momentous consequences. For just at that time I had given up my scholastic post and was opening a new line of work as University Extension Lecturer in Economics and Literature. The first shock came in a refusal of the London Extension Board to allow me to offer courses of Political Economy. This was due, I learned, to the intervention of an Economic Professor who had read my book and considered it as equivalent in rationality to an attempt to prove the flatness of the earth. How could there be any limit to the amount of useful saving when every item of saving went to increase the capital structure and the fund for paying wages? Sound economists could not fail to view with horror an argument which sought to check the source of all industrial progress. Another interesting personal experience helped to bring home to me the sense of my iniquity. Though prevented from lecturing on economics in London, I had been allowed by the greater liberality of the Oxford University Extension Movement to address audiences in the Provinces, confining myself to practical issues relating to working-class life. Now it happened at this time that the Charity Organisation Society was planning a lecture campaign upon economic subjects and invited me to prepare a course. I had expressed my willingness to undertake this new lecture work, when suddenly, without explanation, the invitation was withdrawn. Even then I hardly realised that in appearing to question the virtue of unlimited thrift I had committed the unpardonable sin.\n",
    "181\n",
    "\n",
    "In this early work Mr Hobson with his collaborator expressed himself with more direct reference to the classical economics (in which he had been brought up) than in his later writings; and for this reason, as well as because it is the first expression of his theory, I will quote from it to show how significant and well-founded were the authors' criticisms and intuitions. They point out in their preface as follows the nature of the conclusions which they attack:\n",
    "Saving enriches and spending impoverishes the community along with the individual, and it may be generally defined as an assertion that the effective love of money is the root of all economic good. Not merely does it enrich the thrifty individual himself, but it raises wages, gives work to the unemployed, and scatters blessings on every side. From the daily papers to the latest economic treatise, from the pulpit to the House of Commons, this conclusion is reiterated and re-stated till it appears positively impious to question it. Yet the educated world, supported by the majority of economic thinkers, up to the publication of Ricardo's work strenuously denied this doctrine, and its ultimate acceptance was exclusively due to their inability to meet the now exploded wages-fund doctrine. That the conclusion should have survived the argument on which it logically stood, can be explained on no other hypothesis than the commanding authority of the great men who asserted it. Economic critics have ventured to attack the theory in detail, but they have shrunk appalled from touching its main conclusions. Our purpose is to show that these conclusions are not tenable, that an undue exercise of the habit of saving is possible, and that such undue exercise impoverishes the Community, throws labourers out of work, drives down wages, and spreads that gloom and prostration through the commercial world which is known as Depression in Trade. . .\n",
    "The object of production is to provide 'utilities and conveniences' for consumers, and the process is a continuous one from the first handling of the raw material to the moment when it is finally consumed as a utility or a convenience. The only use of Capital being to aid the production of these utilities and conveniences, the total used will necessarily vary with the total of utilities and conveniences daily or weekly consumed. Now saving, while it increases the existing aggregate of Capital, simultaneously reduces the quantity of utilities and conveniences consumed; any undue exercise of this habit must, therefore, cause an accumulation of Capital in excess of that which is required for use, and this excess will exist in the form of general over-production.\n",
    "In the last sentence of this passage there appears the root of Hobson's mistake, namely, his supposing that it is a ease of excessive saving causing the actual accumulation of capital in excess of what is required, which is, in fact, a secondary evil which only occurs through mistakes of foresight; whereas the primary\n",
    "evil is a propensity to save in conditions of full employment more than the equivalent of the capital which is required, thus preventing full employment except when there is a mistake of foresight. A page or two later, however, he puts one half of the matter, as it seems to me, with absolute precision, though still overlooking the possible rôle of changes in the rate of interest and in the state of business confidence, factors which he presumably takes as given:\n",
    "We are thus brought to the conclusion that the basis on which all economic teaching since Adam Smith has stood, viz. that the quantity annually produced is determined by the aggregates of Natural Agents, Capital, and Labour available, is erroneous, and that, on the contrary, the quantity produced, while it can never exceed the limits imposed by these aggregates, may be, and actually is, reduced far below this maximum by the check that undue saving and the consequent accumulation\n",
    "182\n",
    "\n",
    "of over-supply exerts on production; i.e. that in the normal state of modern industrial Communities, consumption limits production and not production consumption.\n",
    "Finally he notices the bearing of his theory on the validity of the orthodox Free Trade arguments:\n",
    "We also note that the charge of commercial imbecility, so freely launched by orthodox economists against our American cousins and other Protectionist Communities, can no longer be maintained by any of the Free Trade arguments hitherto adduced, since all these are based on the assumption that over-supply is impossible.\n",
    "The subsequent argument is, admittedly, incomplete. But it is the first explicit statement of the fact that capital is brought into existence not by the propensity to save but in response to the demand resulting from actual and prospective consumption. The following portmanteau quotation indicates the line of thought:\n",
    "It should be clear that the capital of a community cannot be advantageously increased without a subsequent increase in consumption of commodities. . .Every increase an saving and in capital requires, in order to be effectual, a corresponding increase in immediately future consumption&nbsp.And when we say future consuniption, we do not refer to a future of ten, twenty, or fifty years hence, but to a future that is but little removed from the present. . .If increased thrift or caution induces people to save more in the present, they must consent to consume more in the future&nbsp.No more capital can economically exist at any point in the productive process than is required to furnish commodities for the current rate of consumption.It is clear that my thrift in no wise affects the total economic thrift of the community, but only determines whether a particular portion of the total thrift shall have been exercised by myself or by somebody else. We shall show how the thrift of one part of the community has power to force another part to live beyond their income. Most modern economists deny that consumption could by any possibility be insufficient. Can we find any economic force at work which might incite a community to this excess, and if there be any such forces are there not efficient checks provided by the mechanism of commerce? It will be shown, firstly, that in every highly organised industrial society there is constantly at work a force which naturally operates to induce excess of thrift; secondly, that the checks alleged to be provided by the mechanism of commerce are either wholly inoperative or are inadequate to prevent grave commercial evil. The brief answer which Ricardo gave to the contentions of Malthus and Chalmers seems to have been accepted as sufficient by most later economists. 'Productions are always bought by productions or services; money is only the medium by which the exchange is effected. Hence the increased production being always accompanied by a correspondingly increased ability to get and consume, there is no possibility of Over-production' (Ricardo, Prin. of Pol. Econ. p. 362).\n",
    "Hobson and Mummery were aware that interest was nothing whatever except payment for the use of money. They also knew well enough that their opponents would claim that there would be 'such a fall in the rate of interest (or profit) as will act as a check upon Saving, and restore the proper relation between production and consumption'. They point out in reply that 'if a fall of Profit is to induce people to save less, it must operate in one of two ways, either by inducing them to spend more or by inducing them to produce less'. As regards the former they argue that when profits fall the aggregate income of the community is reduced, and 'we cannot suppose that when the average rate of incomes is falling, individuals will be induced to increase their rate of consumption by the\n",
    "183\n",
    "\n",
    "fact that the premium upon thrift is correspondingly diminished'; whilst as for the second alternative, 'it is so far from being our intention to deny that a fall of profit, due to over-supply, will check production, that the admission of the operation of this check forms the very centre of our argument'. Nevertheless, their theory failed of completeness, essentially on account of their having no independent theory of the rate of interest; with the result that Mr Hobson laid too much emphasis (especially in his later books) on under-consumption leading to over-investment, in the sense of unprofitable investment, instead of explaining that a relatively weak propensity to consume helps to cause unemployment by requiring and not receiving the accompaniment of a compensating volume of new investment, which, even if it may sometimes occur temporarily through errors of optimism, is in general prevented from happening at all by the prospective profit falling below the standard set by the rate of interest.\n",
    "Since the war there has been a spate of heretical theories of under-consumption, of which those of Major Douglas are the most famous. The strength of Major Douglas's advocacy has, of course, largely depended on orthodoxy having no valid reply to much of his destructive criticism. On the other hand, the detail of his diagnosis, in particular the so-called A + B theorem, includes much mere mystification. If Major Douglas had limited his B-items to the financial provisions made by entrepreneurs to which no current expenditure on replacements and renewals corresponds, he would be nearer the truth. But even in that case it is necessary to allow for the possibility of these provisions being offset by new investment in other directions as well as by increased expenditure on consumption. Major Douglas is entitled to claim, as against some of his orthodox adversaries, that he at least has not been wholly oblivious of the outstanding problem of our economic system. Yet he has scarcely established an equal claim to rank—a private, perhaps, but not a major in the brave army of heretics—with Mandeville, Malthus, Gesell and Hobson, who, following their intuitions, have preferred to see the truth obscurely and imperfectly rather than to maintain error, reached indeed with clearness and consistency and by easy logic but on hypotheses inappropriate to the facts.\n",

    "CONCLUDING NOTES ON THE SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY TOWARDS WHICH THE GENERAL THEORY MIGHT LEAD\n",
    "I\n",
    "The outstanding faults of the economic society in which we live are its failure to provide for full employment and its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes. The bearing of the foregoing theory on the first of these is obvious. But there are also two important respects in which it is relevant to the second.\n",
    "Since the end of the nineteenth century significant progress towards the removal of very great disparities of wealth and income has been achieved through the instrument of direct taxation— income tax and surtax and death duties—especially in Great Britain. Many people would wish to see this process carried much further, but they are deterred by two considerations; partly by the fear of making skilful evasions too much worth while and also of diminishing unduly the motive towards risk-taking, but mainly, I think, by the belief that the growth of capital depends upon the strength of the motive towards individual saving and that for a large proportion of this growth we\n",
    "184\n",
    "\n",
    "are dependent on the savings of the rich out of their superfluity. Our argument does not affect the first of these considerations. But it may considerably modify our attitude towards the second. For we have seen that, up to the point where full employment prevails, the growth of capital depends not at all on a low propensity to consume but is, on the contrary, held back by it; and only in conditions of full employment is a low propensity to consume conducive to the growth of capital. Moreover, experience suggests that in existing conditions saving by institutions and through sinking funds is more than adequate, and that measures for the redistribution of incomes in a way likely to raise the propensity to consume may prove positively favourable to the growth of capital.\n",
    "The existing confusion of the public mind on the matter is well illustrated by the very common belief that the death duties are responsible for a reduction in the capital wealth of the country. Assuming that the State applies the proceeds of these duties to its ordinary outgoings so that taxes on incomes and consumption are correspondingly reduced or avoided, it is, of course, true that a fiscal policy of heavy death duties has the effect of increasing the community's propensity to consume. But inasmuch as an increase in the habitual propensity to consume will in general (i.e. except in conditions of full employment) serve to increase at the same time the inducement to invcst, the inference commonly drawn is the exact opposite of the truth.\n",
    "Thus our argument leads towards the conclusion that in contemporary conditions the growth of wealth, so far from being dependent on the abstinence of the rich, as is commonly supposed, is more likely to be impeded by it. One of the chief social justifications of great inequality of wealth is, therefore, removed. I am not saying that there are no other reasons, unaffected by our theory, capable of justifying some measure of inequality in some circumstances. But it does dispose of the most important of the reasons why hitherto we have thought it prudent to move carefully. This particularly affects our attitude towards death duties: for there are certain justifications for inequality of incomes which do not apply equally to inequality of inheritances.\n",
    "For my own part, I believe that there is social and psychological justification for significant inequalities of incomes and wealth, but not for such large disparities as exist to-day. There are valuable human activities which require the motive of money-making and the environment of private wealth-ownership for their full fruition. Moreover, dangerous human proclivities can be canalised into comparatively harmless channels by the existence of opportunities for money-making and private wealth, which, if they cannot be satisfied in this way, may find their outlet in cruelty, the reckless pursuit of personal power and authority, and other forms of self-aggrandisement. It is better that a man should tyrannise over his bank balance than over his fellow-citizens; and whilst the former is sometimes denounced as being but a means to the latter, sometimes at least it is an alternative. But it is not necessary for the stimulation of these activities and the satisfaction of these proclivities that the game should be played for such high stakes as at present. Much lower stakes will serve the purpose equally well, as soon as the players are accustomed to them. The task of transmuting human nature must not be confused with the task of managing it. Though in the ideal commonwealth men may have been taught or inspired or bred to take no interest in the stakes, it may still be wise and prudent statesmanship to allow the game to be played, subject to rules and limitations, so long as the average man, or even a significant section of the community, is in fact strongly addicted to the money-making passion.\n",
    "185\n",
    "\n",
    "II\n",
    "There is, however, a second, much more fundamental inference from our argument which has a bearing on the future of inequalities of wealth; namely, our theory of the rate of interest. The justification for a moderately high rate of interest has been found hitherto in the necessity of providing a sufficient inducement to save. But we have shown that the extent of effective saving is necessarily determined by the scale of investment and that the scale of investment is promoted by a low rate of interest, provided that we do not attempt to stimulate it in this way beyond the point which corresponds to full employment. Thus it is to our best advantage to reduce the rate of interest to that point relatively to the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital at which there is full employment.\n",
    "There can be no doubt that this criterion will lead to a much lower rate of interest than has ruled hitherto; and, so far as one can guess at the schedules of the marginal efficiency of capital corresponding to increasing amounts of capital, the rate of interest is likely to fall steadily, if it should be practicable to maintain conditions of more or less continuous full employment—unless, indeed, there is an excessive change in the aggregate propensity to consume (including the State).\n",
    "I feel sure that the demand for capital is strictly limited in the sense that it would not be difficult to increase the stock of capital up to a point where its marginal efficiency had fallen to a very low figure. This would not mean that the use of capital instruments would cost almost nothing, but only that the return from them would have to cover little more than their exhaustion by wastage and obsolescence together with some margin to cover risk and the exercise of skill and judgment. In short, the aggregate return from durable goods in the course of their life would, as in the case of short-lived goods, just cover their labour-costs of production plus an allowance for risk and the costs of skill and supervision.\n",
    "Now, though this state of affairs would be quite compatible with some measure of individualism, yet it would mean the euthanasia of the rentier, and, consequently, the euthanasia of the cumulative oppressive power of the capitalist to exploit the scarcity-value of capital. Interest to-day rewards no genuine sacrifice, any more than does the rent of land. The owner of capital can obtain interest because capital is scarce, just as the owner of land can obtain rent because land is scarce. But whilst there may be intrinsic reasons for the scarcity of land, there are no intrinsic reasons for the scarcity of capital. An intrinsic reason for such scarcity, in the sense of a genuine sacrifice which could only be called forth by the offer of a reward in the shape of interest, would not exist, in the long run, except in the event of the individual propensity to consume proving to be of such a character that net saving in conditions of full employment comes to an end before capital has become sufficiently abundant. But even so, it will still be possible for communal saving through the agency of the State to be maintained at a level which will allow the growth of capital up to the point where it ceases to be scarce.\n",
    "I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase which will disappear when it has done its work. And with the disappearance of its rentier aspect much else in it besides will suffer a sea-change. It will be, moreover, a great advantage of the order of events which I am advocating, that the euthanasia of the rentier, of the functionless investor, will be nothing sudden, merely a gradual but prolonged continuance of what we have seen recently in Great Britain, and will need no revolution.\n",
    "186\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we might aim in practice (there being nothing in this which is unattainable) at an increase in the volume of capital until it ceases to be scarce, so that the functionless investor will no longer receive a bonus; and at a scheme of direct taxation which allows the intelligence and determination and executive skill of the financier, the entrepreneur et hoc genus omne (who are certainly so fond of their craft that their labour could be obtained much cheaper than at present), to be harnessed to the service of the community on reasonable terms of reward.\n",
    "At the same time we must recognise that only experience can show how far the common will, embodied in the policy of the State, ought to be directed to increasing and supplementing the inducement to invest; and how far it is safe to stimulate the average propensity to consume, without foregoing our aim of depriving capital of its scarcity-value within one or two generations. It may turn out that the propensity to consume will be so easily strengthened by the effects of a falling rate of interest, that full employment can be reached with a rate of accumulation little greater than at present. In this event a scheme for the higher taxation of large incomes and inheritances might be open to the objection that it would lead to full employment with a rate of accumulation which was reduced considerably below the current level. I must not be supposed to deny the possibility, or even the probability, of this outcome. For in such matters it is rash to predict how the average man will react to a changed environment. If, however, it should prove easy to secure an approximation to full employment with a rate of accumulation not much greater than at present, an outstanding problem will at least have been solved. And it would remain for separate decision on what scale and by what means it is right and reasonable to call on the living generation to restrict their consumption, so as to establish in course of time, a state of full investment for their successors.\n",
    "III\n",
    "In some other respects the foregoing theory is moderately conservative in its implications. For whilst it indicates the vital importance of establishing certain central controls in matters which are now left in the main to individual initiative, there are wide fields of activity which are unaffected. The State will have to exercise a guiding influence on the propensity to consume partly through its scheme of taxation, partly by fixing the rate of interest, and partly, perhaps, in other ways. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the influence of banking policy on the rate of interest will be sufficient by itself to determine an optimum rate of investment. I conceive, therefore, that a somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment will prove the only means of securing an approximation to full employment; though this need not exclude all manner of compromises and of devices by which public authority will co-operate with private initiative. But beyond this no obvious case is made out for a system of State Socialism which would embrace most of the economic life of the community. It is not the ownership of the instruments of production which it is important for the State to assume. If the State is able to determine the aggregate amount of resources devoted to augmenting the instruments and the basic rate of reward to those who own them, it will have accomplished all that is necessary. Moreover, the necessary measures of socialisation can be introduced gradually and without a break in the general traditions of society.\n",
    "Our criticism of the accepted classical theory of economics has consisted not so much in finding logical flaws in its analysis as in pointing out that its tacit assumptions are seldom or never satisfied, with the result that it cannot solve the economic problems of the actual world. But if our central controls succeed in establishing an aggregate volume of output corresponding to full employment as nearly as is practicable, the classical theory comes into its own again from this point\n",
    "187\n",
    "\n",
    "onwards. If we suppose the volume of output to be given, i.e. to be determined by forces outside the classical scheme of thought, then there is no objection to be raised against the classical analysis of the manner in which private self-interest will determine what in particular is produced, in what proportions the factors of production will be combined to produce it, and how the value of the final product will be distributed between them. Again, if we have dealt otherwise with the problem of thrift, there is no objection to be raised against the modern classical theory as to the degree of consilience between private and public advantage in conditions of perfect and imperfect competition respectively. Thus, apart from the necessity of central controls to bring about an adjustment between the propensity to consume and the inducement to invest, there is no more reason to socialise economic life than there was before.\n",
    "To put the point concretely, I see no reason to suppose that the existing system seriously misemploys the factors of production which are in use. There are, of course, errors of foresight; but these would not be avoided by centralising decisions. When 9,000,000 men are employed out of 10,000,000 willing and able to work, there is no evidence that the labour of these 9,000,000 men is misdirected. The complaint against the present system is not that these 9,000,000 men ought to be employed on different tasks, but that tasks should be available for the remaining 1,000,000 men. It is in determining the volume, not the direction, of actual employment that the existing system has broken down.\n",
    "Thus I agree with Gesell that the result of filling in the gaps in the classical theory is not to dispose of the 'Manchester System', but to indicate the nature of the environment which the free play of economic forces requires if it is to realise the full potentialities of production. The central controls necessary to ensure full employment will, of course, involve a large extension of the traditional functions of government. Furthermore, the modern classical theory has itself called attention to various conditions in which the free play of economic forces may need to be curbed or guided. But there will still remain a wide field for the exercise of private initiative and responsibility. Within this field the traditional advantages of individualism will still hold good.\n",
    "Let us stop for a moment to remind ourselves what these advantages are. They are partly advantages of efficiency—the advantages of decentralisation and of the play of self-interest. The advantage to efficiency of the decentralisation of decisions and of individual responsibility is even greater, perhaps, than the nineteenth century supposed; and the reaction against the appeal to self-interest may have gone too far. But, above all, individualism, if it can be purged of its defects and its abuses, is the best safeguard of personal liberty in the sense that, compared with any other system, it greatly widens the field for the exercise of personal choice. It is also the best safeguard of the variety of life, which emerges precisely from this extended field of personal choice, and the loss of which is the greatest of all the losses of the homogeneous or totalitarian state. For this variety preserves the traditions which embody the most secure and successful choices of former generations; it colours the present with the diversification of its fancy; and, being the handmaid of experiment as well as of tradition and of fancy, it is the most powerful instrument to better the future.\n",
    "Whilst, therefore, the enlargement of the functions of government, involved in the task of adjusting to one another the propensitv to consume and the inducement to invest, would seem to a nineteenth- century publicist or to a contemporary American financier to be a terrific encroachment on individualism, I defend it, on the contrary, both as the only practicable means of avoiding the\n",
    "188\n",
    "\n",
    "destruction of existing economic forms in their entirety and as the condition of the successful functioning of individual initiative.\n",
    "For if effective demand is deficient, not only is the public scandal of wasted resources intolerable, but the individual enterpriser who seeks to bring these resources into action is operating with the odds loaded against him. The game of hazard which he plays is furnished with many zeros, so that the players as a whole will lose if they have the energy and hope to deal all the cards Hitherto the increment of the world's wealth has fallen short of the aggregate of positive individual savings; and the difference has been made up by the losses of those whose courage and initiative have not been supplemented by exceptional skill or unusual good fortune. But if effective demand is adequate, average skill and average good fortune will be enough.\n",
    "The authoritarian state systems of to-day seem to solve the problem of unemployment at the expense of efficiency and of freedom. It is certain that the world will not much longer tolerate the unemployment which, apart from brief intervals of excitement, is associated—and, in my opinion, inevitably associated—with present-day capitalistic individualism. But it may be possible by a right analysis of the problem to cure the disease whilst preserving efficiency and freedom.\n",
    "IV\n",
    "I have mentioned in passing that the new system might be more favourable to peace than the old has been. It is worth while to repeat and emphasise that aspect. War has several causes. Dictators and others such, to whom war offers, in expectation at least, a pleasurable excitement, find it easy to work on the natural bellicosity of their peoples. But, over and above this, facilitating their task of fanning the popular flame, are the economic causes of war, namely, the pressure of population and the competitive struggle for markets. It is the second factor, which probably played a predominant part in the nineteenth century, and might again, that is germane to this discussion.\n",
    "I have pointed out in the preceding chapter that, under the system of domestic laissez-faire and an international gold standard such as was orthodox in the latter half of the nineteenth century, there was no means open to a government whereby to mitigate economic distress at home except through the competitive struggle for markets. For all measures helpful to a state of chronic or intermittent under-employment were ruled out, except measures to improve the balance of trade on income account.\n",
    "Thus, whilst economists were accustomed to applaud the prevailing international system as furnishing the fruits of the international division of labour and harmonising at the same time the interests of different nations, there lay concealed a less benign influence; and those statesmen were moved by common sense and a correct apprehension of the true course of events, who believed that if a rich, old country were to neglect the struggle for markets its prosperity would droop and fail. But if nations can learn to provide themselves with full employment by their domestic policy (and, we must add, if they can also attain equilibrium in the trend of their population), there need be no important economic forces calculated to set the interest of one country against that of its neighbours. There would still be room for the international division of labour and for international lending in appropriate conditions. But there would no longer be a pressing motive why one country need force its wares on another or repulse the offerings of its neighbour, not because this was necessary to enable it to pay for what it wished to purchase, but with the express object of upsetting\n",
    "189\n",
    "\n",
    "the equilibrium of payments so as to develop a balance of trade in its own favour. International trade would cease to be what it is, namely, a desperate expedient to maintain employment at home by forcing sales on foreign markets and restricting purchases, which, if successful, will merely shift the problem of unemployment to the neighbour which is worsted in the struggle, but a willing and unimpeded exchange of goods and services in conditions of mutual advantage.\n",
    "V\n",
    "Is the fulfilment of these ideas a visionary hope? Have they insufficient roots in the motives which govern the evolution of political society? Are the interests which they will thwart stronger and more obvious than those which they will serve?\n",
    "I do not attempt an answer in this place. It would need a volume of a different character from this one to indicate even in outline the practical measures in which they might be gradually clothed. But if the ideas are correct—an hypothesis on which the author himself must necessarily base what he writes—it would be a mistake, I predict, to dispute their potency over a period of time. At the present moment people are unusually expectant of a more fundamental diagnosis; more particularly ready to receive it; eager to try it out, if it should be even plausible. But apart from this contemporary mood, the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas. Not, indeed, immediately, but after a certain interval; for in the field of economic and political philosophy there are not many who are influenced by new theories after they are twenty- five or thirty years of age, so that the ideas which civil servants and politicians and even agitators apply to current events are not likely to be the newest. But, soon or late, it is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.\n",

    "## Finance and the Good Society\n",
    "Robert J. Shiller, 2012\n",
    "\n",
    "hat are we to make of a book called Finance\n",
    "and the Good Society? To some readers, this may seem an incongruous coupling of concepts. The word finance is commonly thought of as the science and practice of wealth management—of enlarging portfolios, managing their risks and tax liabilities, ensuring that the rich grow richer. We will revisit—and challenge—this definition of finance later in this chapter. The phrase good society is a term used by generations of philosophers, historians, and economists to describe the kind of society in which we should aspire to live; it is usually understood as an egalitarian society, one in which all people respect and appreciate each other. So at first glance finance, at least as commonly understood, seems to be working against the achievement of the good society.\n",
    "But it is not so simple. Finance has become ever more associated with capitalism. Since the Industrial Revolution, intellectuals have focused their often heated debates about the good society on issues related to capitalism, including the system of markets, private property, legal rules, and class relations. These institutions and issues have increasingly come to define modern society throughout the world. Along with democracy, few ideas have been as pervasive and contentious in defining the good society as capitalism.\n",
    "Debates about capitalism and the good society, from Karl Marx’s incendiary criticisms in the nineteenth century through Milton Friedman’s spirited defenses of free markets in the twentieth, have tended to center on industrial capitalism: the system of production, banking, and trade that shaped modern society up through the end of\n",
    "World War II. But the past several decades have witnessed the rise of financial capitalism: a system in which finance, once the handmaiden of industry, has taken the lead as the engine driving capitalism. Much ink has been spilled over the purely economic aspects of financial capitalism. I too have contributed to this discussion, in my scholarly writings on market volatility and in books such as Irrational Exuberance. The current severe financial crisis has called forth questions not only about the system’s parts but also about financial capitalism as a whole. This crisis—dubbed by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff as the “Second Great Contraction,” a period of weakened economies around the world starting in 2007 but continuing for years after, mirroring the Great Contraction that followed the financial crisis of 1929—has led to angry rejections of the value of financial capitalism.\n",
    "Given this experience, many wonder, what is the role of finance in the good society? How can finance, as a science, a practice, and a source of economic innovation, be used to advance the goals of the good society? How can finance promote freedom, prosperity, equality, and economic security? How can we democratize finance, so as to make it work better for all of us?\n",
    "What’s in a Phrase? Financial Capitalism Evolving\n",
    "The term financial capitalism developed negative connotations as soon as it first became popular in the 1930s with the publication of George W. Edwards’s The Evolution of Finance Capitalism.1 Edwards saw a conspiracy of large financial institutions, with J. P. Morgan at the lead. He called it the Pax Morgana. During the Great Depression critics and much of the public at large blamed the financial system for their plight; they viewed the system as almost feudal, with financiers replacing the lords.\n",
    "The term has recently been revived, and again it is used with hostility. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has said,\n",
    "Purely financial capitalism has perverted the logic of capitalism. Financial capitalism is a system of irresponsibility and is ... amoral. It is a system where the logic of the market excuses everything.2\n",
    "Tony Blair, former British prime minister, speaking of the severe\n",
    "\n",
    "financial crisis that began in 2007, remarked,\n",
    "What is plain is that the financial system has altered its fundamentals, and can never be the same again. What is needed is radical action to deal with the fallout of the crisis.3\n",
    "Grigory Yavlinsky wrote the 500 Days Program of 1990, which outlined the Russian transition to a free-market economy, and was promoted to deputy prime minister to implement it. He began to express similar doubts after the crisis. In his 2011 book Realpolitik, in a section entitled “Structural Shift: From Industrial Capitalism to Financial Capitalism,” he noted that\n",
    "the fundamental structural shifts [are] directly related to a gradual slackening of moral constraints in developed countries. Structural shifts like these follow very fast growth of the financial sector and services directly related to it.4\n",
    "I argue in this book that while critics are correct in some of their indictments, the changes that must be made, rather than having the effect of constraining the innovative power of financial capitalism, should instead broaden its scope. We will make little progress if we simply condemn financial capitalism as a “system of irresponsibility.” But we have the potential to support the greater goals of good societies —prosperous and free societies in the industrialized as well as the developing world—if we expand, correct, and realign finance.\n",
    "The Inexorable Spread of Financial Capitalism\n",
    "At the time of this writing we are still stuck in the severe financial crisis that began in 2007. As such we tend to associate finance with recent problems, such as the mortgage and debt hangovers in the United States and Europe, and with the legal and regulatory errors that preceded these events. But we should not lose sight of the bigger picture. The more important story is the proliferation and transformation of successful financial ideas. Financial innovations emanating from Amsterdam, London, and New York are developing further in Buenos Aires, Dubai, and Tokyo.\n",
    "The socialist market economy, with its increasingly advanced\n",
    "\n",
    "financial structures, was introduced to China by Deng Xiaoping starting in 1978, adapting to the Chinese environment the examples of other highly successful Chinese-speaking cities: Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taipei. The economic liberalization of India, which allowed freer application of modern finance, was inaugurated in 1991 under Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao by his finance minister (later prime minister) Manmohan Singh, who was educated in economics at Nuffield College, Oxford University. The voucher privatization system introduced to Russia in 1992–94 under Prime Minister Boris Yeltsin by his minister Anatoly Chubais, following a modification of the Yavlinsky plan, was a deliberate and aggressive strategy to transform Russia’s economy. The intent was not simply to match the rest of the world in the degree to which finance permeated the daily lives of the Russian people, but to have Russia rank first in the world in public ownership of capital.\n",
    "Such sudden integrations of sophisticated financial structures, originally designed in more financially advanced countries, were not achieved entirely smoothly in these countries, and there was a degree of anger about the inequality of benefits that accrued to some, as opportunists amassed great wealth quickly during the transitions. But China, India, and Russia have seen a flourishing of financial sophistication and amazingly high economic growth rates. And it is not just these countries. According to International Monetary Fund data, the entire emerging world—including the Commonwealth of Independent States, the entire Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America— has proved able to generate annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of over 6% during the past decade, when not compromised by world financial crises.5\n",
    "In addition, a host of international agreements have created institutions that work for the betterment of humankind using sophisticated financial tools. The World Bank, founded in 1944 and today expanded into the massive World Bank Group, has engraved on its headquarters in Washington, D.C., the motto “Working for a World Free of Poverty.” The World Bank was only the first of the multilateral development banks: the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank Group, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern financial institutions are pervasive throughout the world today. Moreover, it is not just stocks or bonds that represent financial markets. One might not at first consider the price of agricultural commodities as relevant to a discussion of financial instruments, but the prices that they fetch on futures exchanges are entirely analogous to prices in the stock and bond markets. Wheat and rice markets are financial markets too, in the sense that they engage in similar activities and rely on comparable technical apparatus, and they are similar in their fluctuations and their impact on the economy. The fact that the very lives of low-income people around the world depend on food prices in some of these markets only underscores the significance of our financial institutions—and the importance of getting these institutions right.\n",
    "Financial Capitalism and Marxian Communism\n",
    "The triumph of financial capitalism or its analogues since the 1970s, even in formerly Marxian communist countries, is one of the most significant revolutions in history, and a radical departure from the past.\n",
    "Communism, in its modern form, had its defining moment in 1848, the year that saw a number of popular uprisings in cities around Europe. Those revolts of the working class did not have an effective leader and were not by themselves communist in nature. They sprang forth from general dissatisfaction at the roots of society. But they created an opportunity for the communist movement to take hold.\n",
    "Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels recognized the significance of these events and in the same year, with the support of the Communist League (originally a Christian organization), published their brief Communist Manifesto—which came across as quite radical and un-Christian. It advocated violent revolution, and Marx and Engels were eventually perceived by many as filling the leadership void in the revolutions of 1848. Even though those revolutions were short lived, their manifesto came to be seen as speaking for the many who had previously remained silent.\n",
    "The word communism comes from the old French commun, meaning common, and refers to the original central tenet of this belief system: the common ownership of capital, the means of production. In this book I refer to the traditional form of communism, not the socialist market\n",
    "\n",
    "economy promoted by the Communist Party in China today, which allows—and even actively encourages—private ownership among members of the public.\n",
    "The central argument for public ownership of capital was, according to Marx in his Capital, to break a vicious cycle of poverty:\n",
    "It is not because he is a leader of industry that a man is a capitalist; on the contrary, he is a leader of industry because he is a capitalist. The leadership of industry is an attribute of capital, just as in feudal times the functions of general and judge were attributes of landed property. ... The capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the laborers from all property in the means by which they can realize their labor. ... The process, therefore, that clears the way for the capitalist system, can be none other than the process which takes away from the laborer the means of his production; a process that transforms on one hand, the social means of subsistence and of production into capital, on the other, the immediate producers into wage laborers.6\n",
    "Marx never explains clearly why it is that laborers do not have access to capital. He implies that under capitalism the goals of society are set by those at the top—those with access to capital—and not by all the people. It remains an unstated assumption that a poor laborer could never start a business by getting credit from a bank or capital from wealthy investors.\n",
    "But in an ideal capitalist system, people with good business ideas can, in principle at least, do just that. Our capitalist institutions do not yet fully live up to this ideal, but throughout history there has been a long trend toward the democratization of finance, the opening of financial opportunities to everyone. It is a trend we must hope will continue into the future.\n",
    "It is true that social barriers prevent some from realizing, and profiting from, their talents. An illiterate farm boy from a remote area finds it difficult to walk into the offices of a bank in a big city to ask for capital to start a business. There is a very real barrier to such people’s accessing capital, and there is substantial evidence of such a barrier in the extreme variation in interest rates paid by borrowers in different\n",
    "\n",
    "regions and different categories. Development economist Esther Duflo summarizes: “This body of evidence makes it very hard to believe that credit markets, at least in the developing world, are anywhere near the ideal market that would make the distribution of wealth irrelevant for investment.”7\n",
    "But this is not a fundamental problem of financial capitalism. It is rather a problem of democratizing and humanizing and expanding the scope of financial capitalism. The same basic issue would remain in Marx’s new society. It is a social dilemma that can be addressed by changes in our educational system. Indeed we have already started to change the system around the world with improved public education and communications.8\n",
    "Financial Capitalism Comes of Age\n",
    "We do indeed live in the age of financial capitalism. We should not regret that. Regulations and restrictions can and should be placed on financial institutions to help them function in the best interests of society, but the underlying logic and power of these institutions remains central to their role. Financial institutions and financial variables are as much a source of direction and an ordering principle in our lives as the rising and setting sun, the seasons, and the tides.\n",
    "Indeed there appears to be no viable alternative. We never hear talk of non-financial capitalism as a model—although one could use such a term to refer to a market economy with poorly developed financial institutions, as we still see today in some poorer regions of the world. As much as we might like to criticize finance, no one seems to view these alternatives as suitable models for anyone’s future.\n",
    "Our task, both in the financial sector and in civil society, is to help people find meaning and a larger social purpose in the economic system. This is no small feat, with all the seemingly absurd concentrations of wealth the system brings about, the often bewildering complexity of its structures, and the games—often unsatisfying and unpleasant—it forces people to play.\n",
    "Definitions matter, and so how we define financial capitalism— getting that definition right—will help us develop a working theory of this most important force. It should set a norm for how finance works and what leaders within business, the public sector, and civil society\n",
    "\n",
    "must do to harness emerging developments within the field of finance to support the goals of a robust and prosperous economy, to curb its excesses, to smooth its volatility, and to consider how finance can be brought to bear to address the needs of advanced and developing economies alike.\n",
    "Toward a Working Theory of Financial Capitalism\n",
    "At its broadest level, finance is the science of goal architecture—of the structuring of the economic arrangements necessary to achieve a set of goals and of the stewardship of the assets needed for that achievement. The goals may be those of households, small businesses, corporations, civic institutions, governments, and of society itself. Once an objective has been specified—such as payment for a college education, a couple’s comfortable retirement, the opening of a restaurant, the addition of a new wing on a hospital, the creation of a social security system, or a trip to the moon—the parties involved need the right financial tools, and often expert guidance, to help achieve the goal. In this sense, finance is analogous to engineering.\n",
    "It is a curious and generally overlooked fact that the very word finance actually derives from a classical Latin term for “goal.” The dictionary tells us that the word derives from the classical Latin word finis, which is usually translated as end or completion. One dictionary notes that finis developed into the word finance since one aspect of finance is the completion, or repayment, of debts. But it is convenient for our purposes to recall that finis, even in ancient times, was also used to mean “goal,” as with the modern English word end.\n",
    "Most people define finance more narrowly. Yet financing an activity really is creating the architecture for reaching a goal—and providing stewardship to protect and preserve the assets needed for the achievement and maintenance of that goal.\n",
    "The goals served by finance originate within us. They reflect our interests in careers, hopes for our families, ambitions for our businesses, aspirations for our culture, and ideals for our society; finance in and of itself does not tell us what the goals should be. Finance does not embody a goal. Finance is not about “making money” per se. It is a “functional” science in that it exists to support other goals—those of the society. The\n",
    "\n",
    "better aligned a society’s financial institutions are with its goals and ideals, the stronger and more successful the society will be. If its mechanisms fail, finance has the power to subvert such goals, as it did in the subprime mortgage market of the past decade. But if it is functioning properly it has a unique potential to promote great levels of prosperity.\n",
    "The attainment of significant goals and the stewardship of the assets needed for their achievement almost always require the cooperation of many people. Those people have to pool their information appropriately. They must ensure that everyone’s incentives are aligned. Imagine the development of a new laboratory, the funding of a medical research project, the building of a new university, or the construction of a new city subway system. Finance provides structure to these and other enterprises and institutions throughout society. If finance succeeds for all of us, it helps to build a good society. The better we understand this point, the better we will grasp the need for ongoing financial innovation.\n",
    "What Finance Does\n",
    "Economists and finance professionals tend to define and discuss finance in narrower terms than those we’ve been employing here. Much research in academic finance is focused on short-term trading strategies and results, and on the related topic of risk management. In its canonical form, academic finance is the science of designing optimal portfolios of investments. Day-to-day activities on Wall Street likewise tend to be concentrated on highly specified activities. But this is only part of what finance really involves.\n",
    "An essential part of what finance professionals actually do is dealmaking—the structuring of projects, enterprises, and systems, large and small—an activity that brings convergence to individuals’ often divergent goals. Financial arrangements—including the structuring of payments, loans, collateral, shares, incentive options, and exit strategies —are just the surface elements of these deals. Dealmaking means facilitating arrangements that will motivate real actions by real people— and often by very large groups of people. Most of us can achieve little of lasting value without the cooperation of others. Even the archetypal solitary poet requires financing to practice her or his art. An income to live on, publishers, printers, arrangers of public readings, the\n",

    "construction of suitable halls for public readings—there is a hidden financial architecture behind all of this.\n",
    "All parties to an agreement have to want to embrace the goal, do the work, and accept the risks; they also have to believe that others involved in the deal will actually work productively toward the common goal and do all the things that the best information suggests should be done. Finance provides the incentive structure necessary to tailor these activities and secure these goals.\n",
    "In addition, finance involves discovery of the world and its opportunities, which ties it in to information technology. Whenever there is trading, there is price discovery—that is, the opportunity to learn the market value of whatever is being traded. This in turn involves the revelation of people’s feelings and motivations, and of the opportunities that exist among groups of people, which may in turn make even more ambitious goals possible.\n",
    "Along with being the science that structures the achievement of goals, finance embodies a vital technology. As such, it has demonstrated continuous progress over the centuries, from the beginnings of money lending in the ancient world through the development of modern mortgage markets as well as the legal and regulatory structures necessary to sustain these innovations. And it will continue to progress. Finance, suitably configured for the future, can be the strongest force for promoting the well-being and fulfillment of an expanding global population—for achieving the greater goals of the good society.\n",
    "Finance Meets the Good Society\n",
    "The real cure for the problem that Marx addressed lies not in destroying the capitalist system but in improving and democratizing it—and improving it means serving the greater goals of the good society. That has always been the best response, to the dismay of radicals.\n",
    "The essential challenge for leaders to contemplate in coming to terms with the future of finance is to understand that it can be used to help broaden prosperity across an increasingly wide range of social classes, and that its products can be made easier for people to use and can be better integrated into the economy as a whole.\n",
    "On the first point, there is nothing in financial theory that specifies\n",
    "\n",
    "that control of capital should be confined to a few “fat cats.” Think of the broadly democratic proliferation of insurance, mortgages, and pensions—all basic financial innovations—in underwriting the prosperity of millions of people in the past century. Further perfecting financial institutions and instruments through innovations large and small will enable society to enlarge the scope of this prosperity and reverse the growing trend toward social inequality.\n",
    "Regarding the second point, designing financial institutions around real human quirks will make it easier for people to adapt financial innovations to their lives and for the financial system as a whole to function more smoothly. This means that psychologists have to be on the financial team, and we must also take account of the revolution in behavioral economics and behavioral finance that has occurred in the past few decades.9 It means that we must smooth the rough edges off our financial system—those aspects that can cause trouble when people make mistakes. It means that people have to be told the truth about the financial contracts into which they enter, and about the ways in which those contracts could be hurtful in the future, so that they can take full account of their emotions and wants before they sign a contract.\n",
    "If we extrapolate historical trends, it will be possible to further extend the scope and range of financial capitalism and render Marx’s criticism—the fundamental basis for his vision of the communist extreme—forever obsolete. Accomplishing this goal will require a degree of government intervention, but not intervention that would frustrate market solutions. Government’s task in this endeavor is to provide a clear set of rules for the game, one that protects consumers and promotes the public interest while enabling the players to compete in doing what they do best: delivering better products and services. A real challenge in this regard is that these rules must have an international dimension, as today’s financial markets are both global in reach and instantaneous in effect.\n",
    "Tomorrow’s Opportunity: Financial Capitalism in the Information Age\n",
    "In his 1995 book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates made a number of predictions about our future in the information age, most of them fanciful. The majority of the more amusing predictions have not yet\n",
    "\n",
    "come to pass. For example, he predicted that some of us will record our entire lives, running video recorders all the time and storing our entire video biographies for future viewing. That idea made for thought- provoking reading, but it hasn’t yet become a reality. What Gates did not predict were numerous other fundamental developments, including the web sites eBay (founded in 1995, the very year his book appeared), Wikipedia, Facebook.com, LinkedIn.com, Zipcar.com, CouchSurfing.org, and a million others that have changed the way we live our lives. He shouldn’t be faulted for failing to predict these—no one could have. Instead we should consider the process through which such innovations happen, and why they happen more in certain environments than in others. That is the real subject of finance.\n",
    "Bill Gates was not presenting a vision of the future of capitalism or of the good society; he was captivated by the engineering details. His predictions seemed to center on little things, on gimmicks. He also did not choose to look very far ahead. The real issue is: What can capitalism do for the good society, with all of the complexity and information linkages a society involves? What little things, in concert with other little things, have the potential to strengthen our sense of fulfillment in our lives? Consider a “little” thing like Facebook, not predicted by Bill Gates in 1995, which can reunite old friends across the years. Is this an important innovation for achieving the good society? It could be, in the sense that it gives people a sense of completion in their lives.\n",
    "The rapid advance of information technology in this century portends numerous—and often frightening—changes, for machines are rapidly replacing human intelligence. A computer program named Soar has the ability not only to play games against humans but also to learn how to play new kinds of games as well.10 The DeepQA program invented at IBM by a group led by David Ferruci can recognize speech and answer general-knowledge questions. The program has been tested in simulated appearances on the television quiz show Jeopardy, and it appears to be able to beat human contestants.11\n",
    "Hearing about such innovations can be demoralizing. We all want to develop our skills to compete as effectively as possible and be successful in the working world. There is no sense in acquiring talents that will be replaced by machines. Unfortunately, it is hard to predict which talents will ultimately matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their 2005 book The New Division of Labor: How Computers Are Creating the Next Job Market, labor economists Frank Levy and Richard J. Murnane argue that computers are replacing routine tasks yet cannot perform what they call “expert thinking” or “complex communication.” In fact, computers are more likely to create jobs requiring these human talents than displace humans from them.12\n",
    "Expert thinking means thinking broadly, interpolating different sources of information and information from different perspectives— information about what is new and current as well as what is perennial and has been forgotten. An example of an expert thinker given by Levy and Murnane is the auto mechanic who is familiar with the computerized diagnostic routines required by modern automobile makers, knows where parts can be found cheaply, is aware of the needs of a variety of customers, and can sense by test driving a car what really should be done.\n",
    "Complex communication refers to the combination of interpersonal skills and understanding complex situations. An example offered by the authors is that of a lawyer, who not only knows the intricacies of the law but also understands what is really in the best interest of the client, given the client’s situation, and can communicate this knowledge to the client persuasively.\n",
    "It is not possible to predict which broad job categories will survive in the face of increasingly sophisticated information technology, for every major occupational group will continue to include some jobs that provide opportunities for both expert thinking and complex communication. But finance, broadly construed, is a field in which such jobs may be especially likely to survive and perhaps even proliferate. Jobs that involve finance are a little like those of the auto mechanic and the lawyer. One must understand the technicalities of financial engineering just as the auto mechanic understands mechanical engineering, and be able to apply that knowledge and sensibility to human problems. One must understand the intricacies of financial institutions (and the legal framework that defines them) and be able to communicate that knowledge to a client.\n",
    "This process has been defining the history of financial innovation for generations. On the streets of New York in the 1840s one would see boys running back and forth, delivering checks, drafts, and other negotiable\n",
    "\n",
    "instruments to the various windows inside banks, and receiving gold and banknotes in exchange. All that disappeared after 1853, with the founding of the New York Clearing House, which soon had fifty-four bank members. This was an important innovation in information technology, even though it might not meet our current idea of such technology since it did not involve any electronics. At ten o’clock every morning representatives of all the major banks would sit down in a large room, each at a designated desk, with all the desks arranged in a circle. A clerk for each of the representatives would then get up from his desk and, simultaneously with all the other clerks, make a round of all the other fifty-three desks, dropping off fifty-three bundles of documents, one for each of the other banks. The whole process took no more than six minutes. Any imbalances would then be summed and paid in gold or banknotes, not by the banks to one another, but to the Clearing House. The jobs of delivering documents and cash on the street faded. But finance itself had not faded.13\n",
    "The technology of clearing improved even more markedly with the advent of the computer. Indeed artificial intelligence systems like DeepQA will soon be available that will be able to answer Jeopardy-like questions about finance. With all these continuing advances in technology, one may wonder what will be left of many jobs in the future. But, for the foreseeable future, computers will not be able to counsel people effectively on what they really need to do with their portfolios, nor to make deals among companies, nor to advise a university department about a new research project, nor to do any of a large number of other jobs. For finance is still about achieving human goals—a task that machines cannot handle in any but the most basic of ways.\n",
    "We shall see in this book that democratizing finance entails the development of both human arrangements—such as those for financial advice, legal advice, and financial education—and technology that works together with these human arrangements to make it possible for everyone to participate intelligently in the financial system.\n",
    "Financial Activities in the Economy\n",
    "Financial activities consume an enormous amount of time and resources,\n",
    "\n",
    "increasingly so over the years. The gross value added by financial corporate business was 9.1% of U.S. GDP in 2010, continuing a long upward trend. By comparison it was only 2.3% of GDP in 1948.14 These figures exclude many more finance-related jobs, such as insurance.15 Information technology certainly hasn’t diminished the number or scope of jobs in finance.\n",
    "To some critics, the current percentage of financial activity in the economy as a whole seems too high, and the upward trend is cause for concern. But how are we to know whether it really is too high or whether the trend is in fact warranted by our advancing economy? What standard do we have? People in the United States spend 40% as much (3.7% of GDP) eating out at restaurants as the corporate financial sector consumes.16 Is eating out a wasteful activity when people could just as well stay home and eat?\n",
    "Surely at least a part of what all these finance professionals are doing is productive: a good number of them are evaluating businesses and directing resources to the more promising of these. But other types of financial activity—trying to outguess the psychology of the market, carrying out high-frequency trading, or advertising dubious financial products—seem not to be very productive.\n",
    "Arjun Jayadev and Samuel Bowles have estimated that 19.7% of the U.S. labor force in 2002—supervisors, security personnel, members of the military—was involved in guarding in some form.17 The high percentage of our citizens paid to guard us and our installations and possessions is at its essence surely more troubling than the percentage engaged in the substantially productive activities of finance. Yet relatively few of us seem bothered by this statistic.\n",
    "Financial Capitalism and the Challenge of Financial Innovation\n",
    "While financial capitalism inevitably must be made to serve the good society, it cannot be summarized in simple terms. This is so because it represents a bewilderingly broad and cross-cutting array of institutions, instruments, and markets, each element of which evolved through a process of invention not unlike the processes that produced our automobiles and airplanes, and through which they continue to evolve.\n",
    "Financial innovation is an underappreciated phenomenon. According\n",
    "\n",
    "to Google Ngrams, the term financial innovation was hardly ever used until the late 1970s and 1980s. The term seems to have been applied first to the controversial financial futures markets that developed around that time. It was shortly thereafter that patent offices began to accept claims for financial innovations. For example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted patent number 4,346,442 to what is now Merrill Lynch in 1982 for its Cash Management Account (CMA).\n",
    "That was a landmark change. Why had the patent authorities not previously thought of financial methods as patentable? A clue can be found in a 1908 U.S. Second Circuit Court decision in the case of Hotel Security Checking Co. v. Lorraine, which set a “business method exemption doctrine” that held sway until around the time of the Merrill CMA decision. The 1908 court held that business methods, whether original or not, are uniformly unpatentable.18 In its decision, the court emphasized that the patent granted, a method for detecting fraud in accounting, used only paper and ink and business common sense. The wording suggested that the court was looking for some proof of concrete innovation as manifested in the “physical means employed.”19 Financial patents thus awaited the application of computers to financial innovation, as in Merrill Lynch’s 1982 patent; a computer programmed to perform a financial service could, at least by the 1908 standard, be considered a physical means.\n",
    "A problem with patenting financial innovations is that they interact with the whole economy; they may produce consequences—including winners and losers—that are evident only years later. The applicant for a financial patent cannot prove the efficacy of the invention as can the inventor of a device submitted for an engineering patent. Since financial innovations interact with people’s foibles—their hopes, their promises, their life savings—patents on them seem to be inherently more controversial than engineering patents. Most financial patents that do not require complex computerized implementation would seem likely to have a long history of prior art that was implemented in some rudimentary form, if never well documented. Indeed a common reaction to many financial patents (including the original 1982 Merrill Lynch CMA patent) has been that they lack the kind of originality underlying inventions of physical devices.\n",
    "But the process of financial innovation is still important, even if it is\n",
    "\n",
    "more at the level of corporate and societal innovation than lone- inventor-in-the-lab creativity. When we describe finance, and how it succeeds, we are aiming at a moving target. Leaders must understand that financial innovation is a messy and sometimes disruptive process. In this book, descriptions of financial products and institutions will have interspersed among them possible directions for future innovation and change.\n",
    "What Follows in This Book\n",
    "This book develops a working theory of financial capitalism to help guide the greater discussion of finance and the good society. It begins, in Part One, with the realities of financial capitalism, as it is constituted today and will be constituted in the future. This part looks at the roles and responsibilities that people take on in the field of finance, from investment bankers through lawyers through regulators and educators. It examines the various organs of the body of financial capitalism—organs that function together to produce a living economic entity, organs that take the form of groups of people bound together in organizations and with particular traditions and ways of operating.\n",
    "There is an unfortunate tendency to talk about the financial system in the abstract, as if it is all about stocks and bonds, or about mathematical equations. But the drivers of financial capitalism are real men and women, who adopt certain personae in our society and make the goals inherent in these roles their own personal goals and the responsibilities associated with these roles their own personal responsibilities. Each such role has its own code of ethics and professional conduct, and it depends on the people filling that role to uphold that code. Here we consider a wide array of such roles, to give a broad picture of the real workings of financial capitalism. As these various roles are discussed, we will consider how they might be improved, and how financial innovation will alter these roles and make the people who assume them more effective.\n",
    "The public hostility that we see today toward financial capitalism often takes the form of anger directed toward the people who fill certain of these roles. An important mission of Part One is to take account of this public hostility, to try to understand, on a role-by-role basis, why particular roles in the financial system are so controversial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part Two of the book takes a more critical look at the financial system that all the people described in the first part have created, and it offers some ideas about how it can and will be improved in the future. It looks at some of the system’s strengths and inspirations, but also at its anxieties and breakdowns—all of which are relevant to any discussion of the role of finance in the good society. The financial system conforms to a large degree to financial theory, which has a sort of beauty that can inspire minds, but also a sort of ugliness, at least in its present form. The financial crises that we experience from time to time are only part of the story. That ugliness can provoke some to dismiss the whole concept of financial capitalism. But it would be foolish to do so, for that would cost us the ability to accomplish some of our most cherished goals.\n",
    "The history of the economic development that has brought the world to its current state of prosperity and enlightenment is a history of many technical adjustments to our financial system, of innovations inspired by financial theory but also based on realistic assessments of human nature. This part of the book indulges in extrapolations of past trends that have resulted in better and better financial systems; it also puts forth a number of concrete ideas for how the system can be improved in coming decades.\n",
    "The epilogue offers some final thoughts on how power is actually wielded in finance, on our negative feelings about the concentration of power we see in the financial world, and on how in a financial democracy such power might be managed and reconciled with basic human values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more aspect of financial capitalism,\n",
    "not fully dealt with in this book so far, that bothers many people deeply. And that is the economic power that some in the financial community attain. Their power in itself rankles. It offends our sense of participation in a society that aspires to respect, appreciate, and support everyone. The pursuit of power that so often seems to drive financial capitalism seems contrary to the concept, promoted in this book, that finance is all about the stewardship of society’s assets.\n",
    "If one searches the bookseller Amazon.com today for the phrase “wealth and power,” one finds that almost eighty-five thousand books come up.1 People may be reading these books to learn how to achieve wealth and power, but a good fraction of the books seem to regard the existence of the wealthy and powerful as a scandal that deserves our contempt.\n",
    "Yet part of the reason successful societies develop power elites is that they need a leadership that has the power to get things done. We have to make it possible for a relatively small number of people—a management —to use their personal judgment to decide on the direction of our major activities. One of the themes of this book has been that despite rapid advances in information technology, we are still just as dependent as ever on the judgment of individual human beings. The faculties of “complex communication” and “expert thinking” that Levy and Murnane found to have survived the information technology revolution are needed as much as ever for coordination of the economy, and a system\n",
    "of financial capitalism will eventually imbue those in possession of such faculties with wealth and power.\n",
    "But there is still a reason that the level of resentment of the wealthy and powerful is so high: a free capitalist system can support an equilibrium in which some kinds of social conspiracy pay off. George Akerlof, in his 1976 article “The Economics of Caste and of the Rat Race and Other Woeful Tales,” has provided an economic theory of the human tendency for certain social groups to form a sort of business conspiracy against outsiders.2 He takes the caste system—most notorious in traditional India, but in fact to some degree a part of human society everywhere—as a long-standing example of this. People who belong to a higher caste realize the immense economic advantage provided by their membership in that caste. Fearful of compromising that status, they adhere to the caste’s social norms—which include ostracizing fellow caste members who fail to adhere to the norms. They favor their own caste in business and reject those who do not belong to the caste or who do belong but flaunt its norms by offering jobs and business to outsiders. Akerlof’s point was that an economic equilibrium with castes can be stable, and that no business that flaunts caste norms can outcompete the caste businesses, so there is nothing to upset the equilibrium.\n",
    "Business communities can be caste-like if there is a suitable culture and there are leaders who encourage exclusionary behavior. Those who have gained admittance to such a community value their connections and favor others in the caste in their business activities and financial dealmaking. In modern society a “caste” may be defined in terms of connections to a specific business culture, or in racial or sexual terms, or it may take form among graduates of elite colleges. If one is in a position of power and uses this opportunity to make an important deal with someone who is not connected with the business group, a member of a minority group, a woman, or merely a nondescript outsider, this behavior may cause one to lose power or even become an outcast. So, instinctively, one shuns outsiders and reconfirms the existing concentration of wealth and power.\n",
    "But these are problems that we associate with finance only because advanced finance is used as a tool by some who wish to preserve their special status. It is not the financial tools themselves that create the caste structure, though their mechanisms are part of the equilibrium. The\n",
    "\n",
    "same financial tools can also, if suitably designed and democratized, become a means to break free from the grip of any caste equilibrium. Truly democratic finance can enable one to escape outcast status.\n",
    "Financial capitalism is a work in progress. It is not yet perfected, but it is gradually improving. As we have seen, it is defined by a long list of financial practices and specific roles and responsibilities for people within those practices. Watching most of these people in operation from day to day, one comes to feel that in our modern society caste-like behavior has been much attenuated.\n",
    "Even the caste system itself has never been accepted by the Buddhist, Christian, and Muslim religions, though caste-like behavior nonetheless continues among many of their adherents. It has survived in the Hindu religion, at least in some of its schools of thought, which have incorporated the notion of caste into their fundamental concepts, so caste loyalty is still very much alive. But even there the system—which was deplored by Mahatma Gandhi and other spiritual leaders—is now declining.\n",
    "The same distaste for castes or their analogues was promoted by Vladimir Lenin in Russia, Kemal Atatürk in Turkey, Yukichi Fukuzawa in Japan, Sun Yat-sen and Mao Zedong in China, Eva Perón in Argentina, and Nelson Mandela in South Africa. These thought leaders couldn’t be more different from each other, but together they provide evidence of a worldwide trend that finds castes or their analogues repugnant. Just as these beliefs represent a trend toward greater social enlightenment, there is a parallel trend toward enlightenment about caste-analogues in the business world.\n",
    "I have been teaching at Yale University for some thirty years. Even my own university has seen a gradual transformation over the centuries from a training center for elite American families to an educational institution serving the people of the world. It has also become a financially sophisticated institution, given its success in investing its endowment. It is private and internationally focused, not connected with the U.S. government—a nonprofit, with its own goals. Those goals are substantially social and benevolent, and reflective of the views of a unique intellectual community.\n",
    "The concept of an aristocracy or “high society,” so strong in the nineteenth century, is fading around the world. The Social Register is a\n",
    "\n",
    "publication listing the wealthy and socially prominent families in the United States. Inclusion in it was once a coveted symbol of membership in the elite. Today it is largely a list of the descendants of the same families who were wealthy and prominent a century ago, and it has largely been forgotten by mainstream society.3 Much the same has happened to Burke’s Peerage in the United Kingdom and its European counterpart, the Almanach de Gotha, which ceased publication in 1944.4 In China the national records of degree-holding literati and the local gazetteers died out before the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912. There is a more egalitarian spirit abroad in the world, and this spirit is supported by democratized finance.\n",
    "Partly it is the presumption, the arrogance, that accompanies economic power that rankles. And the fact that so many people seem to admire the wealthy and powerful bothers us. Why do people think the wealthy are so special? Even presidents wonder about that. Franklin D. Roosevelt once said,\n",
    "I am simply unable to make myself take the attitude of respect toward the very wealthy men which such an enormous multitude of people evidently feel. I am delighted to show any courtesy to Pierpont Morgan or Andrew Carnegie or James Hill, but as for regarding any of them as, for instance, I regard ... Peary, the Arctic explorer or Rhodes the historian—why I could not force myself to do it even if I wanted to, which I don’t.5\n",
    "Most of us might think that Roosevelt himself was rich. After all, in the 1940s his family was the most prominent of all in the Social Register, with no less than a page and a half of entries.6 But he was not among the extremely rich, and apparently he did not feel that he was one of them either.7 He seems to have considered himself at the same distance from these people that most of us do, and this mindset must have been a factor in his New Deal policies, which helped democratize U.S. financial markets.\n",
    "At times we seem to be stuck in an economy that arbitrarily elevates a small number of the undeserving and forces the rest of us to pamper and flatter them. Resentment of such circumstances can suddenly build up to an intense level. For example, in 2011 the board of the Miami Art Museum announced that the museum would be renamed the Jorge M.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pérez Art Museum of Miami-Dade County in recognition of a donor, a real estate developer, who had given $35 million to the museum in the form of his personal collection of Latin American art, valued at $15 million, and a pledge of another $20 million.8 A storm of protest followed. The museum had been funded mostly by taxpayers, and a $220 million capital campaign relying on numerous small donors was under way. It appears that the acknowledgment to Mr. Pérez was misapplied. Perhaps the board should have offered only to name a wing of the museum or an auditorium within the museum after him, and then refused his gift if that was not enough for him. The granting of recognition in exchange for gifts has to be handled sensitively.\n",
    "But we are usually not so sure that we bear any resentment toward such wealthy donors, for sometimes they do seem deserving. Often we set aside our social comparison processes because these donors do not seem in any way comparable to ourselves, and sometimes we imagine that we or our children could actually be as successful as they are\n",
    "It has always been a source of satisfaction to me that Yale University, where I teach, has not followed a policy of selling naming rights to the highest bidder. For example, the names of all twelve of its residential colleges are those of distinguished alumni, not merely wealthy donors who “bought” their way onto the colleges’ walls. The Yale Law School and the Yale School of Management are not named after anyone—yet. If one or the other is someday named after a philanthropist donor, there will have to be general agreement within the university community on the worthiness of that person.\n",
    "Part of this acceptance of wealthy donors is just the natural human willingness to live and let live. Each of us has other ways of maintaining self-esteem besides achieving wealth. So we want an economic system that allows for the attainment of human potential in various forms; we want it to be basically fair. Most of us will choose not to try to get rich, and we will pursue meaning in our lives in our own ways. We realize that we can’t build an economic system that allows most of us to be prosperous and healthy and able to pursue our own individuality without producing some unusually successful, and possibly arrogant, people\n",
    "The democratization of finance entails relying more on effective institutions of risk management that have the effect of preventing\n",
    "\n",
    "random redistributions of power and wealth—a system of financial contracts. Finance is supposed to reduce randomness in our lives, not increase it. To make the financial system work well, we have to further develop its inherent logic, its own ways of making deals among independent and free people—deals that leave them all better off.\n",
    "The democratization of finance as spelled out in this book calls for an improvement in the nature and extent of participation in the financial system, including awareness of fundamental information about the workings of the system. The public needs to have reliable information, and that can only be provided by advisers, legal representatives, and educators who see their role as one of promoting enlightened stewardship. When people can benefit from such help, they will come to feel less strongly that our economy is run by a power elite. At present most people have little or no such information. Instead they are routinely confronted by salespeople for financial products, who have inadequate incentive to tell them what they really need to know. But it could be different, under a truly enlightened system of financial capitalism.\n",
    "We have seen that some government interventions are needed, including redistributions through a progressive income tax, and this could be done more deliberately and judiciously than at present, without raising alarms that wealth might be unfairly confiscated. There needs to be a social safety net, and this safety net has to be continually improved and reworked. But under financial capitalism many of our best protections, and inspirations, come not directly from the government but from our own private financial arrangements. The government can merely be a facilitator.\n",
    "The democratization of finance works hand in hand with the humanization of finance. To that extent it is important that finance be humane, and that it incorporate our increasingly sophisticated understanding of the human mind into its systems, models, and predictions. The rise of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics in recent decades provides a foundation for such an approach, for understanding how people really think and act. People are not inherently and uniformly loving to their neighbors, but our institutions can be changed to reward the better side of human nature.\n",
    "One of these better sides is the philanthropic impulse, and the\n",
    "\n",
    "tendency, at least in the right social environment, for wealthy people to give much of their wealth away constructively. As we have seen, such a tendency ought to be considered central to financial capitalism. The gifts of the wealthy might in some respects be self-serving or motivated by ego, and they may in some cases generate resentment rather than gratitude, but financial capitalism makes full sense only when we recognize the importance of their gifts.\n",
    "A problem with philanthropy is that, in the words of Craig Calhoun, president of the Social Science Research Council, there is a “loss of dignity for workers and citizens to feel they are dependent on charitable gifts—rather than on protections rightly available to them.”9 Yes indeed, the financial power that some achieve is resented, even if they eventually give away much of the wealth from which that power derives. But wealth accumulation followed by charity will still play a fundamental role in the good society, for, as we have seen, allowing or even actively encouraging people to amass wealth and give much of it away creates a system that motivates them to do good things. The loss of dignity that Calhoun notes can be minimized, and it may be more than offset by the overall beneficial results of such a system.\n",
    "This conclusion is perhaps more sobering than inspiring. From what we know of human nature, we must continue to perfect a system that provides outlets for people’s aggressive nature, that allows them to be egotistical. The system must also give them the opportunity to express their better natures at some point in their lives, for the good of society as a whole.\n",
    "In my Financial Markets class, I ask students to read the philosopher Peter Unger’s 1996 book Living High and Letting Die.10 The book remarks at the widespread indifference—not just among the rich, but among the majority of the population—to the true suffering of poverty-stricken people we do not see every day. Unger tells us that it is not so easy for those of us in developed countries—or in the advanced parts of less- developed countries—to justify this neglect. He takes apart the moral arguments we use to justify this indifference, concluding that they are self-serving and specious. However, there is something futile about his exhortations, for relatively few people read Unger’s book or change their behavior after having heard his message.\n",
    "Other philosophers have taken the view not only that it is futile to\n",
    "\n",
    "ask people to be charitable, but also that human nature is essentially focused on a quest for power. Friedrich Nietzsche was very influential in promoting this view, and he was an inspiration for aggressors in both World War I and World War II. He wrote in The Will to Power (1901) of his theory\n",
    "that the will to power is the primitive form of affect, that all other affects are only developments from it; that it is notably enlightening to posit power in place of individual “happiness” (after which every living thing is supposed to be striving): there is a striving for power, for an increase of power;—pleasure is only a symptom of the feeling of power attained ... that all driving force is will to power, that there is no other physical, dynamic or psychic force except this.11\n",
    "Nietzsche seems to a modern ear almost to be saying that the brain is hardwired for a lust for power.12 However, he overstates his case: neuroscience shows many patterns of behavior in the brain, including altruistic impulses, which cannot all be derived from any unitary “psychic force.”13\n",
    "One singularly important human impulse, which Nietzsche did not seem to appreciate but that is emphasized by Adam Smith in his book Theory of Moral Sentiments, is not a desire for power per se but a desire for praise.14 We see this desire plainly in the behavior of the youngest children and the oldest and weakest people, those with no hope of attaining “power” over others.\n",
    "There is an enormous literature in modern psychology confirming the importance of self-esteem. But Smith gave his discussion of the desire for praise a different slant, one perhaps more closely aligned with the contemporary psychological literature on essentialism,15 and one still not as appreciated today as it ought to be. Smith wrote that in mature people the desire for praise is transformed into a desire for praiseworthiness:\n",
    "The desire of the approbation and esteem of those we live with, which is of such importance to our happiness, cannot be fully and intirely contented but by rendering ourselves the just and proper objects of those sentiments, and by adjusting our own character\n",
    "\n",
    "and conduct according to those measures and rules by which esteem and approbation are naturally bestowed. ... We are pleased not only with praise, but with having done what is praiseworthy.16\n",
    "He seems almost to be saying that this craving is inherent in the human psyche and that our brain wants to categorize the praise we receive by its essential truth, by the real category of people into which it places us. Smith notes that most people would find it unsatisfying to be praised by mistake, for something they did not do. No one is satisfied merely to look praiseworthy. One wants to be praiseworthy. This is an aspect of human nature that is essential to the success of our economic system.\n",
    "It is human to view a forged painting in entirely different terms than a genuine one, even though in many cases no one but an expert could tell the two apart. One might think that we would be just as happy to have a nice forgery hanging on the wall—after all, it gives us the same visual gratification. But we most certainly are not. In the same way, one does not want to be a forged person. Even criminals who commit frauds and violent crimes probably do not either. They merely imagine that they are praiseworthy within the confines of a moral philosophy that they perceive as sharing with their social group.\n",
    "Economic development is in substantial measure the development of a social milieu in which it is harder and harder to find others who will truly feel that corrupt behavior is actually praiseworthy.\n",
    "Pablo Escobar, the notorious Colombian drug lord, had hundreds of public figures, including a presidential candidate, assassinated, and he even had a commercial passenger airliner bombed, killing 110 people. When he was finally hunted down and killed by Colombian security forces in 1993, his mother, Hermilda Gaviria, demonstrated a strong conviction that her son, however brutal, was a good man because of what he had done for his family and the poor people in his community. At his funeral, amidst adoring throngs of his supporters, she said, “Pablo, you’re in heaven, and the people acclaim you. The people love you. You have triumphed, Pablo.”17 Escobar probably did have a generous side. Had his business been legal and run within a system of financial capitalism, his aggressive instincts might have been channeled into mostly productive directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a society is fragmented into fiefdoms run by primitive warlords, it is easier to feel praiseworthy for one’s antisocial activities. The same society may in time evolve to a higher level at which the warlords are gone, but the government and business sectors remain filled with corruption, bribery, and caste-like behavior. Once again, those involved may still feel praiseworthy because there is a viewpoint—which they view as well entrenched in their society—that the laws they are breaking are meant to be broken and that one must do so to support one’s friends and family.\n",
    "As we mature we come to have the inner sense that we are praiseworthy, and not just superficially so. That, as Adam Smith observed, is a fundamental aspect of human nature that makes human society, and the economy, work as well as they do.\n",
    "Ultimately, a well-constituted financial capitalism creates a safe venue for power struggles without violence. Achieving such a system requires appropriate innovations that humanize finance, taking account of our increasing knowledge from behavioral economics and neuroeconomics. There is no known economic system that can perfect aggressive human impulses—but they can be softened.\n",
    "Financial institutions and associated regulations are like the rules of war. They lessen the unnecessary damage from human aggression, and they work to encourage the expression of other, more charitable, human impulses. We have seen that alternative economic systems work less well than a developed financial capitalism in their handling of the more difficult aspects of human nature.\n",
    "Before modern financial capitalism, power was wielded in much more stark ways. For example, throughout most of human history, hostage exchange was used to guarantee agreements between governments.18 A king might be forced to give up his son to spend years in the land of a rival leader, with the understanding that the son would be killed if the king did not live up to a treaty or other bargain. Because of the outrageous inhumanity of such a practice, it is now eschewed by respectable governments the world over.\n",
    "Many of us will remember Brendan Behan’s 1957 play The Hostage, which tells the story of an eighteen-year-old British soldier who is taken hostage by the Irish Republican Army. He strikes up a romance with an Irish woman of the same age who has been given the job of taking care\n",
    "\n",
    "of him in captivity—and then he has to be killed. The play vividly reveals the inhumanity of war and its tactics.\n",
    "But modern finance has not done away with all forms of hostage exchange to seal deals. The term for modern-day hostage exchange is collateral, and the hostages are financial assets instead of people. The practice was elevated to a high level before the severe financial crisis that began in 2007, with the widespread use of repurchase agreements, or repos, to carry financing farther forward. Even the home mortgage is in essence a hostage exchange, one in which the home (and the sense of equilibrium and well-being it provides to its inhabitants) is the hostage. The foreclosure on a house for failure to make the mortgage payments has its human consequences too, and it may lead to tragedies not entirely unlike that described in Behan’s play. But the home mortgage could not have been made in the first place without such a collateral arrangement.\n",
    "Many of our hopes for the future should be pinned on further development of the institutions representing financial capitalism. We are easily dazzled today by advances in information technology, and these advances can certainly interact positively with financial innovations. But the advances in our economic institutions may ultimately be more important than those in our hardware and software. The financial system is itself an information-processing system—one built out of human, rather than electronic, units—and the field of artificial intelligence is nowhere close to replacing human intelligence.\n",
    "The key to achieving our goals and enhancing human values is to maintain and continually improve a democratic financial system that takes account of the diversity of human motives and drives. We need a system that allows people to make complex and incentivizing deals to further their goals, and one that allows an outlet for our aggressions and lust for power. It must be a system that redirects the inevitable human conflicts into a manageable arena, an arena that is both peaceful and constructive.\n",

    "## BITCOIN - ASSET OR CURRENCY? REVEALING USERS' HIDDEN INTENTIONS\n",
    "Glaser, Florian, et al., \n",
    "\n",
    "Digital currencies are a globally spreading phenomenon that is frequently and also prominently addressed by media, venture capitalists, financial and governmental institutions alike. As exchange prices for Bitcoin have reached multiple peaks within 2013, we pose a prevailing and yet academically unaddressed question: What are users' intentions when changing their domestic into a digital currency? In particular, this paper aims at giving empirical insights on whether users’ interest regarding digital currencies is driven by its appeal as an asset or as a currency. Based on our evaluation, we find strong indications that especially uninformed users approaching digital currencies are not primarily interested in an alternative transaction system but seek to participate in an alternative investment vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital currencies propose a shift away from the established design of financial system infrastructures. Information systems and technological solutions like peer-to-peer connectivity and cryptographic algorithms allow for decentralized organisation, operational security and transparency, thus opposing the centrally coordinated and less transparent traditional monetary systems’ structures (Samuelson, 1968). Against the backdrop of the recent economic crisis, this new breed of currencies is gaining public attention. As public trust in the current structure of the financial system crumbles, alternative concepts become more relevant and introduce innovative concepts for future currency systems.\n",
    "The digital currency that attracts most attention within this context is Bitcoin, proposed by Nakamoto (2008). Bitcoin is an electronic financial mechanism providing features that resemble an established currency system with its own money creation and transaction regime but relies on a decentralized organizational structure. In contrast to the central bank’s discretionary decision making, money creation in the Bitcoin system is transparently realized by a distributed and open algorithm, facilitating the reliability of expectations about the future supply of money. Likewise, the infrastructure allows near-real-time transaction monitoring via the public peer-to-peer network. The entire transaction history is stored in a ‘chain’ (Nakamoto, 2008) of transactions, frequently referred to as Blockchain.\n",
    "The Blockchain represents all verified and valid transactions between users of the network. In contrast to previous digital currencies which can rather be seen as community currencies being available to a community of users participating in online games, Bitcoin has a wider focus and is independent from a central institution responsible for money creation. Thus, such an innovative system is not only attracting a steadily increasing level of media attention, but also increasing global dissemination and growing to a market capitalization of roughly $13 billion as of December 2013.\n",
    "The story of Bitcoin is, however, equally unique as it is controversial. With a dollar value of $0.3 per Bitcoin in January 2011, the exchange rate skyrocketed through $1300 in November 2013. This considerable increase in dollar value and foremost the volatile exchange rate fluctuations in early and late 2013 not only incur the attention of national regulators, but also raise concerns about the utility of the Bitcoin transaction system and the rationality of its users. Foremost, the high exchange rate volatility provides indications that Bitcoin is not utilized as alternative transaction system, but rather considered as a speculative financial asset. In 2012, the European Central Bank stated that Bitcoin should be considered as a high-risk system for its users from a financial perspective. Up to now it is not easy to assess whether or not the Bitcoin system might be a pyramid or even a Ponzi scheme (European Central Bank, 2012). China has announced to prohibit the use of Bitcoin as currency for financial institutions (Ruwitch and Sweeney, 2013).\n",
    "Taking into account these considerations as well as recent developments, we pose the following central research question: What are users' intentions when changing their domestic currency into a digital currency? We therefore test users’ intentions with respect to two general possible purposes: First, Bitcoin serving as an alternative payment system, where users acquire Bitcoin to easily and cheaply execute financial (cross-border) transactions or buy and sell goods. Second, we test if Bitcoin users seek an alternative, highly speculative asset, where users primarily acquire Bitcoin in order to accumulate returns when exchange rate rises. To answer this question, our analysis is split into two consecutive steps. At first, we analyze the users’ attention directedness, i.e. the way uninformed people get in touch with Bitcoin, and try to reveal which of these two purposes they intent to pursue. Secondly, we cross-validate the observations of our first analysis by evaluating possible behavioral objectivity biases that new users are likely to be subject to.\n",
    "In contrast to previous research on centralized community currencies, with Bitcoin, we investigate a decentralized system which is independent from a central institution responsible for money creation. A system that also has a broader focus beyond specific communities as, for example, online game communities. Furthermore, in comparison to other digital currencies, analyzing Bitcoin offers the unique possibility to investigate the specific transaction behavior of its users, since transactions are publicly available through the Bitcoin Blockchain mechanism. Consequently, we extend previous research that only focuses on technological rather than economic issues related to Bitcoin by studying the aggregated behavior of new and uninformed Bitcoin users within the time span from 2011 to 2013. We seek to identify the intentions why people gather information about Bitcoin and their motivation to participate subsequently.\n",
    "Our results provide strong indications that newly attracted users primarily limit their relation to Bitcoin to trading on exchanges. Although the Bitcoin payment system is still predominant in terms of absolute transaction volumes, we find that users’ current focus and growth is limited to trading on exchanges. Facing our results, we further argue that the recent dissemination of Bitcoin is lead by a shift of the average users’ intention regarding the utilization of Bitcoin. New users do not seem to consider Bitcoin’s original purpose of being used as an alternative transaction system. They tend to solely perceive Bitcoin as an alternative investment vehicle.\n",
    "The remainder of our work is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of recent literature on digital currencies and points out the, so far academically uncovered, perspective of the digital markets and their users. In section 3, we develop our hypotheses in order to address our initial research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Background and Related Work\n",
    "2.1 Digital currencies\n",
    "Before the emergence of Bitcoin, there have been several examples of digital currencies that attracted a wide range of attention. These currencies have the design of a local community currency in a closed environment, for instance in the case of online games, and are designed to be payment opportunity within these specific environments. Kaplanov (2012) reaches the conclusion that Bitcoin mostly resembles a community currency. Research conducted in this area, however, at best provides distantly related results regarding utilization and behavior. For an alternative examination of the features of Bitcoin and a legal classification refer to (Krohn-Grimberghe and Sorge, 2013). Authorities like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) acknowledge Bitcoin as (convertible) virtual currency with respect to its functionality but distinguish it from a “real” currency due to the lack of having a legal tender status in any country (FINCEN, 2013; IRS, 2014). From a tax perspective in the USA, Bitcoin and virtual currencies in general a treated as a commodity. The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB) apply the term virtual currency (European Central Bank, 2012; European Banking Authority, 2013).\n",
    "For example, the digital currency Linden Dollar which is rooted in the virtual world of Second Life (http://secondlife.com/) experienced a similar media hype like Bitcoin. Ernstberger (2009) analyzes policies for virtual money based on Linden dollar. He finds that Linden dollars are used as money equivalent and hence extend the spending of money into a virtual environment. Put differently, he discovers that users in second life spend money in a way similar to the way people spend money in the real world. As the economy of Second Life is bound to the given platform, previous research neglects aspects of Linden Dollar's economical-technical relationship, but focuses on its unique potential as virtual environment for virtual education and learning (Zhu et al., 2007). Previous research did not address economical effects of Linden dollar, as Second Life is mostly seen as a new paradigm of learning supported by a virtual community currency (Molka-Danielsen, 2009).\n",
    "Another example for a more successful digital currency is virtual gold embedded in the virtual ecosystem of the massive multiplayer game “World of Warcraft” (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/). While these currencies were quite successful inside their environment, due to the closed design of these systems, they never achieved a spillover into the real world like Bitcoin seems capable of. The closedness of the system hampers empirical analyses on the economic impact and the relation to other currencies. In contrast, Bitcoin allows analyzing the emergence of a digital currency in an open, i.e. decentralized environment, enabling wider analytical and empirical analyses.\n",
    "Henceforth, we will, if helpful, refer to Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency due to its unique features differing from features of other digital currencies, e.g. those mentioned above.\n",
    "2.2 Technical Issues, Risks and Anonymity\n",
    "Previous work on Bitcoin can roughly be divided into two streams. The first stream of research has been targeting the design and the technology underlying the decentralized infrastructure of Bitcoin, i.e. its protocol and risks arising on a technical level. Various techniques based on network theory have been applied to conduct analyses regarding transaction anomalies and possibilities of de-anonymizing single entities in the Blockchain. For instance, Reid and Harrigan (2011) show that users and Bitcoin addresses may be mapped passively by the usage of centralized services such as currency exchanges and online wallets. On the basis of a day-to-day usage scenario of Bitcoin on a university campus, Karame et al. (2012) analyze with a quasi-simulative approach the anonymity of Bitcoin-users. They find that 40% of the students can be profiled passively which therefore also leads them to reject the anonymity hypothesis regarding Bitcoin. In addition, Karame et al. (2012) show that double spending is possible under the circumstance of a fast payment (i.e. a payment which is not verified in the Blockchain) and therefore they propose a modification of the current Bitcoin implementation. Clark and Essex (2012) leverage the Bitcoin-system to introduce a method to securely timestamp a document.\n",
    "The second research stream on Bitcoin focuses on the risks involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Brezo and Bringas (2012) analyze the risks involved with cryptocurrencies by the example of Bitcoin. They highlight that Bitcoin is vulnerable to speculation and misinformation and they also criticize that no regulatory body oversights the market. A vital component in the Bitcoin-ecosystem are currency- exchanges as they link traditional currencies with the digital ones. Due to the fact that they are not regulated and are thus not subject to risk mitigation and governance requirements, they have a substantial default risk, e.g. caused by hacker attacks or even technical problems. Consequently, Moore and Christin (2012) analyze the main factors which contribute to a default of these exchanges. They find that popularity and transaction volume decrease the probability of a closure. Analyzing the conversion rate on currency exchanges, Buchholz et al. (2012) show that the price risk (volatility of the currency rate) had a positive effect on price development in 2011 - a characteristic which is also shared by asset bubbles. This leads them to the conclusion that the Bitcoin ecosystem is currently in a state of an asset bubble.\n",
    "The range of perspectives, taken so far by academic research, neglects the user perspective and therefore the layer connecting the technological infrastructure with the established economies. Put differently, the layer of businesses and users has not been taken into account adequately, although it is residing on top of the technical infrastructure and is the link which is leveraging the idea of a peer-to- peer based digital currency into the established economic global environment.\n",
    "Consequently, this analysis is focusing on retail users trading Bitcoin on exchanges and trading goods against Bitcoin respectively, i.e. by paying with Bitcoin in online shops.\n",
    "The focus of this study is to close the previously outlined research gap and to extend the current streams of technically focused literature with a perspective on the users’ motivation to adopt Bitcoin. Our intention, motivating this work, is to draw a holistic picture of what cryptocurrencies currently are - speculative investment or payment system - and how the volumes traded on exchanges and in the network can provide means to draw conclusions on the prevailing usage of cryptocurencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to early digital currencies which are connected with central institutions for money supply and which are limited to certain communities, for instance in the field of online games, Bitcoin represents a decentralized currency that has gained popularity within the media and attracted a large user base. Previous research only investigated the technological aspects of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency, disregarding the user perspective on Bitcoin. In this paper we investigate a fundamental research question: What intentions are users following when changing a domestic currency into a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin? We therefore analyze whether the demand for exchanging the domestic currency into Bitcoin increases along with initial attention on Bitcoin and whether the actual usage of Bitcoin, i.e. using Bitcoin as a currency in order to buy or sell goods, also increases.\n",
    "In order to investigate this research question empirically, trading data of a Bitcoin exchange, transaction data from the Bitcoin Blockchain, visitor statistics for the Bitcoin Wikipedia article and dates of important Bitcoin events were collected. Our research design is based on following a two step approach. Step one comprises investigating whether Bitcoin intra-network transaction and on- exchange trading volumes are linked. In a second step, we elaborate if new users have an impact on both types of volume and draw conclusions about the users' intentions.\n",
    "Consequently, we contribute to the literature on digital and cryptocurrencies in general and to the literature on Bitcoin in specific by providing indications that new Bitcoin users rather use it as an asset than as a currency. The interest of new users has an influence on the Bitcoin volume traded at the exchange but not on the volume within the Bitcoin system. One interpretation of the results is that exchange users buying Bitcoin for the first time are likely to keep these Bitcoins in their exchange wallet for speculation purposes and do not have the intention to use these acquired Bitcoins for paying goods or services. Furthermore, the interpretation that Bitcoin is used as asset is also supported by the fact that Bitcoin returns react on news events related to this digital currency. However, we find indications that Bitcoin users are limited in their level of professionalism and objectivity, which is highlighted by their bias towards positive news.\n",
    "Thus, new users tend to trade Bitcoin on a speculative investment intention basis and have low intention to rely on the underlying network as means for paying goods or services. To add further robustness to our analysis we added manifold control parameters while our results stay the same. Yet, we face several limitations about the time series consistency and generalizability of our results. Our analysis only covers the last three years of Bitcoin history. However, we provide indications about recent progress and dissemination within this digital currency.\n",
    "Furthermore, we are aware that our analysis is mainly based on the exchange data of a single exchange. Nevertheless, Mt. Gox covered 80\\% of overall exchange volume related to Bitcoin during the observation time span, hence we argue that investigating Mt. Gox data gives appropiate insights on the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n",
    "Within future research, we plan to include smaller exchanges as well and analyze how they relate to the incumbent ones. Additionally, in order to investigate whether fundamental characteristics of financial markets also hold for Bitcoin markets, we plan to extend our analysis by investigating if possibilities for inter-exchange arbitrage exist and whether behavioral biases such as herding dominate the Bitcoin user decision making.\n",
