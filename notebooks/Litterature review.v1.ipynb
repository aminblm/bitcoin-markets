    "The emergence of cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin, has challenged traditional financial markets, with its decentralized, trustless and low-cost features. The unpredictable nature of Bitcoin prices, combined with the unique properties of this digital currency, has prompted a surge of research into developing methodologies for predicting its price movements. This literature review presents a comprehensive analysis of the work of leading experts in the field of Bitcoin price prediction, including Nobel laureate Robert Shiller and distinguished academics such as Anders Johansen, Nikolaos Kyriazis, and Stephanos Papadamou.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this review will reveal, the prediction of Bitcoin prices is a complex task that requires consideration of numerous factors, ranging from market sentiment and investor behavior to the detection of bubbles and the identification of outliers. The aim of this literature review is to examine the different approaches and methodologies used to predict Bitcoin prices, providing insights and a deeper understanding of the fascinating world of Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study highlights the fundamental drivers of Bitcoin prices, including the position of the blockchain, the hashrate, and the liquidity. The analysis also explores the legal and regulatory aspects of Bitcoin, given its uncertain status as a \"security\" within federal securities laws. The authors found compelling evidence supporting the view that Bitcoin is in a bubble phase, having entered this stage since the price exceeded \\$1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this literature review are of significant value to regulators, investors, and governments who are increasingly considering Bitcoin as a potential investment asset. As such, the following sections will provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on predicting Bitcoin prices, focusing primarily on the GARCH-type and LPPL-type models. By exploring these models, this study aims to provide a roadmap for future research in this critical field of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this literature review brings together the latest research into predicting Bitcoin prices, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in this fascinating field. The findings provide insights for investors, regulators, and governments who seek to navigate the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. So, let us embark on this journey together, as we explore the exciting world of predicting Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "In \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" Satoshi Nakamoto (2009) proposed a decentralized digital currency system called Bitcoin that enables electronic transactions without relying on trusted third parties. While the paper does not discuss predicting Bitcoin prices, it lays the foundation for the creation of Bitcoin and the blockchain technology that underpins it. Researchers have subsequently used the blockchain technology to predict Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robert Shiller's work is relevant to predicting Bitcoin prices as it highlights the importance of understanding market sentiment and investor behavior. Shiller argues that asset prices are driven by various factors and change from time to time. In \"Speculative Asset Prices\" (2014), Shiller discusses the discourse in the profession between rationality and behavioral finance, which considers alternative psychological, sociological, and epidemiological factors that affect prices. Similarly, in \"The New Financial Order, Risk in the 21st Century\" (2003), Shiller proposes a new financial infrastructure that utilizes financial inventions to protect people against systemic risks, securing the wealth of nations and preserving economic gains that sustain people globally. The proposals in the book can be applied to predicting Bitcoin prices by leveraging new financial technologies to gain insights into market sentiment and investor behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anders Johansen, Olivier Ledoit, and Didier Sornette's (2000) study assumes that a crash may be caused by local self-reinforcing imitation between noise traders. The \"critical\" point is the point at which the tendency for noise traders to imitate their nearest neighbors increases up to a certain point, causing a crash. Traders remain invested provided they are compensated by a higher rate of growth of the bubble for taking the risk of a crash. The model distinguishes between the end of the bubble and the time of the crash, with the date of the crash being random. Empirical evidence shows that certain critical log-periodic patterns were present before the crashes of 1929, 1962, and 1987 on Wall Street and the 1997 crash on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. However, this study does not provide any specific predictive model for Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robert Shiller's study (2008) states that the subprime crisis was caused by the deflating of a speculative bubble in the US housing market that began in 2006 and cascaded across many other countries. The housing bubble that created the subprime crisis ultimately grew as big as it did because we as a society do not understand or know how to deal with speculative bubbles. Shiller argues that allowing these destructive changes to proceed unimpeded could cause damage not only to the economy but also to the social fabric for decades to come. However, this study does not provide any specific predictive model for Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brock and Hommes (1997) investigated a simple asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs and how it could lead to market instability and strange attractors, such as cycles or even chaotic fluctuations. The study showed how different expectation schemes between rational and naive traders could lead to bifurcations of the monetary steady state and market instability. The findings suggest that heterogeneity in beliefs may lead to complicated dynamics in financial markets and predicting Bitcoin prices could be challenging due to the presence of different types of traders with different expectations about future prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nikolaos Kyriazis, Stephanos Papadamou, Shaen Corbet, and Frehen et al. (2020) reviewed the existing literature on detecting bubbles and revealed that bubbles consist of a run-up phase that leads to formation of bubbles and imbalances, and a crisis phase where accumulated risk materializes, and the crisis breaks out. Asset markets are directed by mercurial investors acting on the basis of short-lived enthusiasms and bubbles. The paper also notes that no consensus exists regarding the tracing and detection of bubbles, and that rational bubbles appear when asset prices keep rising due to investors' beliefs that there will be a possibility to sell the overvalued asset at a higher price in the future. The study did not provide any specific predictive model for Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geuder et al. (2019) use the Phillips et al. (2015) PSY methodology and the log-periodic power law (LPPL) approach by Filimonov and Sornette (2013) to identify and analyze bubble behavior in Bitcoin prices. They find that bubble behavior is a common and recurring characteristic of Bitcoin prices and that cryptocurrencies offer an ideal setting for testing speculative behavior. The authors identify December 6, 2017, as a critical time point after which neither approach provides evidence of ongoing bubble behavior. They suggest that the fear of missing out of many private investors may have accompanied Bitcoin's price increase in December 2017. Future research may analyze the reasons and determinants of Bitcoin price behavior, including global monetary environment for fiat currencies, institutional changes, and regulatory changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fry and Cheah (2016) develop models for financial bubbles and crashes using tools and techniques from statistical physics and mathematical finance. They find evidence of negative bubbles in cryptocurrency markets and a spillover effect from Ripple to Bitcoin. They develop a model to independently verify the impact of putative market shocks upon Bitcoin. Despite being a fast-moving and unconventional area, there is a wealth of statistical information available about Bitcoin and other digital currencies that renders academic study of the area entirely possible. The authors also highlight the legal, regulatory, and ethical challenges associated with cryptocurrency markets and the concerns that the anonymity endowed by cryptocurrencies may encourage illegal activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sornette (2012) develops the concept of \"dragon-kings\" to refer to meaningful outliers that coexist with power laws in the distribution of event sizes in a variety of systems. Dragon-kings reveal the existence of self-organization mechanisms that are not apparent from the distribution of their smaller siblings. The author suggests that the presence of a phase transition, bifurcation, catastrophe, or tipping point is often associated with dragon-kings, and their emergence can provide clues for diagnosing a system's maturation towards a crisis. A variety of concrete examples are described, especially on the application of the diagnostic of financial bubbles and the prediction of their demise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sornette (2014) develops the log-periodic power law (LPPL) model to detect bubbles by combining economic theory of rational expectation bubbles, behavioral finance on imitation and herding of investors and traders, and the mathematical and statistical physics of bifurcations and phase transitions. The LPPL model considers the faster-than-exponential increase in asset prices decorated by accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. It embodies a positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations. The LPPL model was successfully used to predict time windows for the crashes of the Shanghai stock exchange composite index (SSEC) and the Shenzhen stock exchange component index (SZCI) during the 2005–2007 and 2008–2009, Chinese stock market bubbles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sornette and Helmstetter (2003) examined the precursory and recovery patterns in response to shocks of endogenous versus exogenous origins in systems with long-range persistence and memory. The study highlights the possibility of distinguishing between an endogenous versus exogenous cause of a given shock, even when there is no \"smoking gun.\" This concept can be applied concretely to differentiate the effects on financial markets of exogenous versus endogenous shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fry (2012) presented a unifying framework for a set of seemingly disparate models for exogenous and endogenous shocks in complex financial systems. The paper provides a novel framework unifying the various models for crash precursors and after-shock patterns in financial and social systems. The models for endogenous and exogenous market crashes have several applications to risk management and further research avenues. Empirical applications of the models show that the terror attacks of 9/11 represent an exogenous shock, while the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers is an endogenous event.\n",
    "\n",
    "MacDonell (2014) used LPPL models to predict the crash that occurred in December 2013, making LPPL models a potentially valuable tool for understanding bubble behavior in digital currencies. The value of Bitcoin is primarily driven by the level of public interest over time and the level of investor confidence in traditional markets. LPPL models can be applied to historical financial bubbles to predict the timing of crash events and were able to predict the crash that occurred in December 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wheatley et al. (2019) developed a strong diagnostic for bubbles and crashes in Bitcoin by analyzing the coincidence (and its absence) of fundamental and technical indicators. A generalized Metcalfe’s Law based on network properties was used to quantify a fundamental value, which was shown to be heavily exceeded on at least four occasions by bubbles that grow and burst. The study detected a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth in these bubbles and modeled this pattern with the LPPLS model, which provides an ex ante warning of market instabilities and quantifies a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the crash time consistent with the actual corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is a new type of currency that is not backed by any nation-state or tangible asset, and is created through private agreement and facilitated by the anonymity of the internet. Bitcoin is the most widespread cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of 15 billion as of December 2016, representing 89% of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Aurelio F. Bariviera et al. (2017) investigated the statistical properties of Bitcoin and compared it with standard currencies during the period 2011-2017. The study focused on the analysis of returns at different time scales and tested the presence of long memory in return time series. The Hurst exponent was computed using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window to measure long-range dependence. The study expanded the empirical studies by analyzing the long memory of a new asset, compared the behavior of Bitcoin with some major currencies, and highlighted the evolution in the underlying dynamics of this new market. The authors found that Bitcoin is more suitable as an asset for speculative purposes, and speculation has a long history and seems inherent to capitalism. However, Bitcoin's properties as a currency are not well-established, as it is barely accepted as a medium of exchange, not used as a unit of account, and not a suitable option for storing value due to its great swings in price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shaen Corbeta et al. (2018) examined the existence and dates of pricing bubbles in Bitcoin and Ethereum using the Phillips et al. methodology. The authors examined the fundamental drivers of the price, including blockchain position, hashrate, and liquidity. The authors concluded that there are periods of clear bubble behavior, with Bitcoin now almost certainly in a bubble phase. The European Central Bank found in 2012 that cryptocurrencies do not jeopardize financial stability, but the market for cryptocurrencies has evolved significantly since then. The authors found no clear evidence of a persistent bubble in the market for both Bitcoin or Ethereum, but there are distinct short-term time periods in which each fundamental influences the price dynamics of both cryptocurrencies. The authors found evidence supporting the view that Bitcoin is currently in a bubble phase and has been since the price increased above \\$1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reuben Grinberg (2011) discussed Bitcoin as a digital, decentralized, and partially anonymous currency, not backed by any government or other legal entity, and not redeemable for gold or any other commodity. Bitcoin relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity, making it highly liquid, with low transaction costs and the ability to make micropayments. Bitcoin's potential to facilitate anonymous transactions could allow organizations like Wikileaks to receive donations and conduct business without risking monetary seizure or sanctions. As of October 2011, one bitcoin is worth about two US dollars, and over 20 million bitcoin wallets exist. The Bitcoin economy is flourishing, but users are anxious about its legal status and the possibility of a government crackdown. Critics point to Bitcoin's potential for facilitating money laundering, tax evasion, and trade in illegal drugs and child pornography. Bitcoin operates in a legal grey area, and its status as a \"security\" within the meaning of federal securities laws is uncertain. Other legal issues that could affect Bitcoin include tax evasion, banking without a charter, state escheat statutes, and money laundering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Khaled Guesmi et al. (2019) defined private money as a widely accepted medium of exchange or payment issued by a non-governmental body in the absence of any legal privileges. Private monies do not have to be generally acceptable; they merely have to be widely accepted. There is a public demand for and interest in private currencies from various groups of people. Examples of contemporary private monetary systems include the Liberty Dollar, e-gold, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gartz and Linderbrandt (2017) examine the future of cryptocurrencies, with a particular focus on Bitcoin, and highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have gained popularity in Sweden due to the growing interest in digital assets and payment methods. A transition to cryptocurrency has both advantages and disadvantages, including time and cost-efficient payments, decentralized participation, and increased payer integrity. However, the large energy consumption and security concerns pose significant obstacles to Bitcoin's further growth. Cryptocurrencies do not fulfill the functions of traditional currency, and a complete transition to cryptocurrency seems unfavorable for Sweden at present. Cryptocurrencies will coexist with traditional currencies and payment systems, and a transition may occur in the future when the market has matured and solutions to problems have been presented. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be implemented, and as of April 29th, 2017, there exist over 800 cryptocurrencies with a total market capitalization of approximately 309BSEK. Today, Bitcoin dominates 61.4% of the cryptocurrency market, followed by Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phillip, Chan and Peiris (2018) explore the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies exhibit diverse stylized facts, including long memory and heteroskedasticity. A single model can be used to conditionally measure the varied nature of cryptocurrencies, which helps evaluate their investability. Cryptocurrencies in general have unique properties, including leverage effects and Student-t error distributions. Academic interest in anonymous communications research dates back to the early 1980s. Nakamoto resurrected philosophies of Chaum with the addition of crowd sourcing and peer-to-peer networking to create the first digital currency, which offered anonymity through cryptographic protocols. The Cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy and is inefficient, with evidence of price clustering. Cryptocurrencies are drawing media and academic attention. Empirical data analysis shows that cryptocurrencies exhibit long memory, leverage, stochastic volatility, and heavy tailedness. The study expands its analysis to cover 224 cryptocurrency indices to contribute to a deeper understanding of cryptocurrencies. The study provides insights for regulators, investors, and governments to explore the topic further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baur et al. (2018) examine Bitcoin as a hybrid between fiat currency and commodity currency without intrinsic value and independent of any government or monetary authority. Bitcoin is mainly used as a speculative investment and not as an alternative currency and medium of exchange. Potential users of virtual currencies as a medium of exchange may be attracted by its low transaction costs, peer-to-peer, global and government-free design, and the possibility to purchase special goods for which the seller may prefer virtual currency. The success of the virtual currency as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value will depend on the balance between potential users and investors. Bitcoin returns are essentially uncorrelated with all major asset classes in normal and extreme times, offering large diversification benefits and low risk from a macro perspective. Bitcoin is designed as a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system and thus a medium of exchange. It can be defined as synthetic commodity money sharing features with both commodity monies such as gold and fiat monies such as the US dollar. Bitcoin is a hybrid of commodity money and fiat money.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Several previous studies have examined the volatility of Bitcoin prices using various GARCH-type models. For example, Bouri et al. (2017) used the EGARCH model to analyze the impact of several macroeconomic factors on Bitcoin volatility, while Kurihara and Fukushima (2016) used the GJR-GARCH model to study the dynamic correlation between Bitcoin and other financial assets. However, most studies have only used a single conditional heteroskedasticity model to capture Bitcoin's volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Katsiampa's study aims to address this gap in the literature by comparing different GARCH models to determine which model best describes the volatility of Bitcoin prices. The study used four different models: GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, and AR-CGARCH. The results indicate that the AR-CGARCH model outperforms the other models in capturing the volatility of Bitcoin prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the study finds that incorporating both short-run and long-run components of the conditional variance is significant for achieving the best goodness-of-fit to Bitcoin price data. This suggests that the long-term persistence of Bitcoin volatility should be considered when modeling its price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conlon and McGee (2020) investigated Bitcoin's safe haven properties during the COVID-19 bear market, the first significant market loss since Bitcoin's inception. The study found that Bitcoin did not act as a safe haven, decreasing in price in tandem with the S&P 500. Holding even a small allocation of Bitcoin alongside the S&P 500 increased portfolio downside risk, contrary to expectations of diversification benefits. Loss aversion among investors may prompt them to seek out safe haven investments during market turbulence, but the results cast doubt on Bitcoin's ability to provide shelter from traditional market turmoil. The paper concludes that investors should not rely on Bitcoin as an alternative asset that provides shelter from turbulence in traditional markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper by Katsiampa (2019) examines the diversification and hedging effectiveness of Bitcoin across gold asset and stock market. The study shows that all models confirm the significant returns and volatility spillovers between Bitcoin and financial indicators. A short position in the Bitcoin market allows hedging the risk investment for all different financial assets. Hedging strategies involving gold, oil, equities, and Bitcoin reduce considerably the portfolio's risk as compared to the risk of the portfolio made up of gold, oil, and equities only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bouria et al. (2017) studied Bitcoin's hedging and safe haven properties and found that Bitcoin is a poor hedge but can be used for diversification purposes. Bitcoin can serve as a strong safe haven only against weekly extreme down movements in Asian stocks. Bitcoin's hedging and safe haven properties vary between horizons. Bitcoin can act as an effective diversifier for most of the cases. The liquidity of Bitcoin is a concern, and its diversification ability may not be constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper by Glaser et al. (2014) aims to give empirical insights on whether users' interest in digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, is driven by its appeal as an asset or as a currency. The results suggest that uninformed users approaching digital currencies are primarily interested in an alternative investment vehicle. Users' current focus and growth regarding Bitcoin is limited to trading on exchanges rather than utilizing it as an alternative payment system. New users do not seem to consider Bitcoin's original purpose of being used as an alternative transaction system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cheah and Fry (2014) investigated the presence of speculative bubbles in Bitcoin markets and whether the currency has any fundamental value. They found that Bitcoin exhibited speculative bubbles, similar to other asset classes. The authors also argued that the fundamental value of Bitcoin is zero, and its fluctuations in prices are not suggestive of a constant fundamental value. Furthermore, the authors noted that Bitcoin's proliferation and lack of regulation may encourage black market activities to flourish, and there are cybersecurity risks associated with its use. Overall, the study suggests that the speculative component of Bitcoin prices warrants further investigation, as it could potentially signify bubbles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kristoufek (2013) explored the relationship between Bitcoin prices and search queries on Google Trends and Wikipedia. The study found that there exists a connection between search queries and prices, and there is a pronounced asymmetry between the effect of an increased interest in the currency while being above or below its trend value. The results suggest that the public's interest in Bitcoin, as reflected in search queries, can have an impact on its prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phillip et al. (2018) proposed a new method for hypothesis testing in vector autoregressions (VARs) with possibly integrated processes. The authors argued that conventional asymptotic theory is not applicable to hypothesis testing in levels VARs if the variables are integrated or cointegrated. They proposed a method that is robust to the integration and cointegration properties of the process and can test linear or nonlinear restrictions on the coefficients by estimating a levels VAR and applying the Wald test. This method could be useful for predicting Bitcoin prices, as it can overcome the problems in hypothesis testing when VAR processes may have some unit roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the literature review provides valuable insights into the challenging task of predicting Bitcoin prices. The multifaceted nature of the cryptocurrency market necessitates a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates economics, finance, psychology, sociology, and epidemiology. The review highlights the importance of understanding market sentiment, investor behavior, and the various factors that drive asset prices. The identification of critical log-periodic patterns and the presence of bubbles add complexity to the prediction process. However, opportunities exist to leverage new financial technologies to gain insights into market sentiment and investor behavior. The future of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, is uncertain, and issues such as energy consumption and security concerns must be addressed. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and further exploration by regulators, investors, and governments is likely. Overall, predicting Bitcoin prices is a challenging but essential task for anyone interested in understanding the ever-changing landscape of digital currencies."
